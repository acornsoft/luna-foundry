# Constitution Phase Instructions

## Overview

The Constitution phase establishes the foundational principles, constraints, and manifesto for the project. It ensures alignment with Acornsoft's Grok-native ecosystem, xAI principles, and truth-seeking development.

## Purpose

- Define project vision and core values
- Establish technical and operational constraints
- Align with Grok/xAI first principles
- Set the tone for lean, mean, truth-seeking development

## Inputs

- High-level project requirements
- Stakeholder goals
- Existing Acornsoft patterns and constraints

## Process

1. Review Acornsoft manifesto and Grok principles
2. Identify key constraints (Grok-only stack, C# primacy, etc.)
3. Define success criteria and boundaries
4. Document foundational decisions

## Outputs

- Constitutional framework document
- Key principles and constraints
- Alignment confirmation with xAI ecosystem

## Grok Integration

Use Grok for first-principles reasoning to validate foundations. Temperature: 0.7 for creative alignment.

## Next Phase

### ADR 019: Add GitHub CLI to Luna Foundry Tech Stack

**Date**: 2026-01-09  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Context**: Luna Foundry requires tools for repository management, pull requests, and automation to support deployment and collaboration workflows. GitHub CLI (gh) provides command-line access to GitHub features, aligning with our Grok-native stack and VS Code integration.  
**Decision**: Add GitHub CLI as a required technology in the Constitution, install it via MSI download, and integrate into sync-deployment and PR processes. Update luna.instructions.md to include it in Hard Technology & Style Constraints.  
**Consequences**:  
- Positive: Enables automated PR creation, repo operations, and seamless GitHub integration for Luna Foundry.  
- Negative: Adds external dependency, requires authentication setup.

# ADR 006: Document Foundry Directory Structure with Mermaid Diagram

**Date**: 2026-01-03  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: The Luna Foundry's `src/foundry` directory structure has evolved with agents, instructions, prompts, and skills. To improve clarity for developers and stakeholders, we need visual documentation of the structure, including intents for each folder and subfolder. This will aid in onboarding, maintenance, and alignment with MacroFlow principles.  
**Decision**: Add a Mermaid diagram to `MacroFlow-Analysis.md` visualizing the directory structure, with an introductory paragraph and short explanations for each folder's intent and contents. Generate this as part of the documentation update process.  

**Consequences**:  

- Positive: Enhances understanding and navigation of the Foundry, reduces confusion during development.  
- Negative: Adds maintenance overhead for keeping the diagram updated as structure changes.

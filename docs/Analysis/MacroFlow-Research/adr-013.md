# ADR 013: Integrate GitHub Repository Links in Azure DevOps Work Items

**Date**: 2026-01-06  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: To ensure traceability and integration between Azure DevOps work items and the GitHub repository for Luna Foundry, we need to embed hyperlinks to the GitHub repo in work item descriptions. This supports easy navigation from ADO to source code, commits, and issues. MCP tools do not support external links, so we use Azure CLI for updates. Work items should include links to the main repo, specific commits (via AB#ID), and relevant issues. For agent skills integration, refer to the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).  
**Decision**: Add GitHub hyperlinks to work item descriptions using Azure CLI updates, including links to the repository homepage, commit history, and issues. Standardize tags to include "GitHub; luna-foundry; Luna; MacroFlow" for filtering. Use HTML in descriptions for clickable links.  
**Consequences**:  
- Positive: Enhances traceability, enables quick access to GitHub from ADO, supports integrated workflows.  
- Negative: Descriptions become HTML-heavy; requires CLI for updates, not MCP.

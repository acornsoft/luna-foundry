### ADR 017: Clean Up Redundancies and Prioritize Skills in Luna Foundry

**Date**: 2026-01-08  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: The .github folder has redundant files (e.g., phase-specific instructions duplicating MacroFlow, prompts overlapping agents). To prioritize skills for extensible behavior over additional instructions/prompts/agents, and ensure neutrality for broader use, a cleanup is needed. This aligns with Grok-native evolution and reduces maintenance overhead.  
**Decision**: Update luna.instructions.md with Skills Integration section, migrate detailed content from redundant instructions to skills, neutralize company-specific references, and prepare for removal of redundants. Follow checklist: audit, update core, migrate, test, remove, version.  
**Consequences**:  
- Positive: Streamlined structure, skills-driven extensibility, neutral for client use, easier maintenance.  
- Negative: Temporary disruption during migration; requires testing to ensure no breakage.

# ADR 025: Implement Cross-Instance Work Item Refinement and Cloning

## Status
Accepted

## Date
January 12, 2026

## Context
Luna Foundry requires seamless migration and enhancement of requirements across Azure DevOps instances to support distributed development. The Requirements-Writing skill needs to handle retrieval from source instances (e.g., ecolabDevOpsServer), analysis of content, refinement with Luna Foundry standards, and creation in target instances (e.g., acornsoftDevOpsServer). This addresses gaps in cross-project consistency and iterative improvement of templates.

## Decision
Implement cross-instance Work Item refinement and cloning capability in the Requirements-Writing skill. The process includes:
- MCP-based retrieval of source Work Items.
- Analysis of tags, descriptions, and fields for intent and quality.
- Refinement using skill templates, adapting to Luna Foundry context (e.g., MacroFlow integrations).
- Creation of enhanced versions in target instances with proper linking.

This will be integrated into MacroFlow phases (Clarify for analysis, Specify for refinement, Implement for creation).

## Consequences
- Positive: Consistent requirements across projects, iterative skill improvement from real examples, reduced manual migration effort.
- Negative: Dependency on MCP access, potential for field mapping errors if schemas differ.
- Risks: Data privacy concerns with cross-instance access; mitigated by secure MCP authentication.
- Future: Extend to batch processing and automated refinement suggestions.

# ADR 024: Completion and Refinement of MacroFlow Sub-Agents

## Status

Accepted

## Date

January 12, 2026

## Context

Following the establishment of MacroFlow as a flow network model (ADR 023), we completed quick-turn refinements of all sub-agents (Constitution, Clarify, Specify, Plan, Tasks, Implement, Luna core) to ensure consistency, Grok integration, and production readiness. Each agent now includes structured sections: Purpose, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Behaviors, Grok Integration, Related Capabilities. ADO work items were updated with estimates, tags, and comments for tracking.

## Decision

Accept the refined sub-agents as the baseline for MacroFlow orchestration. All agents follow the same template, integrate Grok with appropriate temperatures (0.3 for code, 0.7 for creative), and reference phase-specific instructions and skills.

## Rationale

1. **Consistency**: Unified structure ensures predictable behavior across phases.
2. **Grok-Native**: Leverages Grok's unique features (X insights, uncensored ideation) for superior AI outputs.
3. **ADO Integration**: Syncs progress with work items for traceability and stakeholder visibility.
4. **Scalability**: Agents are modular, allowing parallel execution in the flow network.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Ready for end-to-end MacroFlow testing and implementation.
- Improved developer experience with clear agent behaviors.
- Foundation for agentic workflows in Luna Foundry.

### Negative

- Ongoing maintenance required as agents evolve.
- Potential for over-standardization if flexibility is needed.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Defer Refinements**: Would delay MacroFlow readiness.
2. **Custom Structures**: Could lead to inconsistencies.

## Future Actions

- Test MacroFlow end-to-end with sample tasks.
- Implement orchestration in Azure Functions.
- Evolve agents based on usage feedback.

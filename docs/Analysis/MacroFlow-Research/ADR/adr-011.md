# ADR 011: Establish Markdown-Driven Sync Schemas for App Collaboration

**Date**: 2026-01-06  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Shared state for app sync lacks structure, risking inconsistent data exchange. We need clear schemas to define MacroFlow phases and context across modalities.  
**Decision**: Define JSON schemas in Markdown documents (e.g., sync-schema.md) for objects like { "sessionId": guid, "phases": array, "context": string }, ensuring human-readable specs for development.  
**Consequences**:  
- Positive: Provides clear, versioned specs for reliable sync; easy to iterate in Markdown.  
- Negative: Initial documentation effort; schemas may evolve with usage.

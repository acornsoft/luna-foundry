# ADR 019: Develop Complete Requirements-Writing Skill for Full Work Item Hierarchy

**Date**: 2026-01-10  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Analysis of real-world Azure DevOps work items from client projects revealed the need for a comprehensive Requirements-Writing skill covering the full hierarchy (Epic > Feature > Requirement > User Story > Task > Test Case) to enable verbose, testable outputs for client work item creation. Initial work covered Epics and Features; expansion is required for a 360-degree solution.  
**Decision**: Refine the Requirements-Writing skill in .github/skills/requirements-writing/ with sub-skills for each hierarchy level, deriving approaches and templates from CSV data analysis, and integrate with MacroFlow for structured development.  
**Consequences**:  

- Positive: Provides a reusable, data-driven tool for creating high-quality work items, improving client deliverables and reducing manual effort.  
- Negative: Increases skill complexity and maintenance overhead; requires ongoing validation against evolving work item patterns.

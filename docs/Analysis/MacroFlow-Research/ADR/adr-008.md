# ADR 008: Make Skills Compliant with VS Code Agent Skills Standard

**Date**: 2026-01-03  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: The Luna Foundry initially developed skills in a custom format (.skill.md files with config.json) within src/foundry/skills/ for development. However, VS Code's Agent Skills feature requires compliance with the open Agent Skills standard (https://agentskills.io), mandating SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter in .github/skills/ directories for automatic loading and portability across agents (VS Code, Copilot CLI, GitHub Copilot coding agent). To fully support skills in the Luna Foundry ecosystem, we need to standardize the format, establish a development-to-deployment sync process, and ensure skills integrate with MacroFlow phases. This includes updating development definitions to match the standard, enabling progressive loading (metadata first, then instructions, then resources), and supporting shared/community skills.  
**Decision**: Adopt the Agent Skills standard for all Luna Foundry skills: 1) Update development files in src/foundry/skills/ to use SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter (name, description) and standard body structure; 2) Implement a sync mechanism to deploy skills from src/foundry/skills/ to .github/skills/ for VS Code compatibility; 3) Include additional resources (scripts, configs, prompts) in skill directories as per the standard; 4) Document skill integration points in MacroFlow (e.g., Document Generator in Implement phase, Forensic Coder in Clarify/Specify); 5) Enable support for shared skills from repositories like github/awesome-copilot.  

**Consequences**:  

- Positive: Ensures portability and automatic activation across compatible AI agents; simplifies skill creation and sharing; aligns with VS Code's preview features for better user experience; enables progressive loading for efficient context management.  
- Negative: Requires refactoring existing skill definitions and maintaining sync processes; potential for version drift between dev and deploy locations; dependency on VS Code Insiders for full functionality.  
- Risks: Skills may not load if frontmatter is malformed or descriptions don't match use cases; security risks if shared skills are not vetted; increased complexity in managing multiple skill locations.  
- Mitigation: Implement validation scripts for SKILL.md format; establish code review for shared skills; automate sync via PowerShell scripts or CI/CD; provide migration guide for existing custom skills; monitor VS Code updates for standard changes.

### ADR 015: Implement Azure DevOps Feature for Luna Foundry Pre-Requisites Tracking

**Date**: January 7, 2026  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Context**: Luna Foundry setup involves multiple pre-requisites (tools, extensions, repos) that need tracking in Azure DevOps for team consistency and automation. Manual checks are prone to oversight.  
**Decision**: Add a custom work item type "Luna Pre-Req Check" in ADO, linked to MCP for automated validation and updates during Constitution phase.  
**Consequences**:  
- Positive: Centralized tracking, automated validation, improved setup reliability.  
- Negative: ADO customization complexity, potential performance impact on large projects.

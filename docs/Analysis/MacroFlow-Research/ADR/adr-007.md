# ADR 007: Refine Document Generation Skill via Eat-Your-Own-Dog-Food Approach

**Date**: 2026-01-03  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: The Document Generation skill has been developed as a bundled capability for creating branded client deliverables from Markdown. To ensure it meets production needs and integrates seamlessly with MacroFlow, we need to test and refine it by applying it to our own documentation, such as MacroFlow-Analysis.md. This "eat your own dog food" approach will validate the skill's effectiveness, identify gaps in configuration, template management, and process flow, and align it with agent-driven workflows.  
**Decision**: Implement an iterative refinement process for the Document Generation skill: 1) Identify 2-3 focus areas (e.g., output path accuracy, template fallback, agent integration), 2) Apply the skill to MacroFlow-Analysis.md to generate DOCX output with Mermaid processing, 3) Review results and update skill definitions, prompts, and scripts accordingly, 4) Document findings in an ADR for future reference.  

**Consequences**:  

- Positive: Improves skill reliability, ensures MacroFlow integration, provides real-world validation.  
- Negative: May require additional testing cycles; potential for minor disruptions if templates are missing.  
- Risks: Dependency on external tools (Pandoc, Mermaid) could introduce failures if not properly configured.  
- Mitigation: Include fallback mechanisms and clear error handling in the skill.

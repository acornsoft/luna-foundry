# ADR 010: Implement Baseline Azure Function for Cross-App Sync

**Date**: 2026-01-06  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Syncing chats across Grok Desktop, VS Code, and VS 2026 is manual and error-prone, causing workflow drift. We need a centralized way to persist MacroFlow sessions without violating Grok's safety rules.  
**Decision**: Develop a baseline Azure Function (C# .NET 10) with HttpClient for polling Grok API and storing shared state in Azure Blob/Cosmos DB. Include timer-triggered sync every 5-10 minutes.  
**Consequences**:  
- Positive: Enables real-time-ish collaboration, maintaining session continuity.  
- Negative: Adds infrastructure overhead and API costs; requires secure key management.

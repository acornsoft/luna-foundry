### ADR 014: Add Transition Labels to Luna Agent for MacroFlow Guidance

**Date**: 2026-01-07  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: The Luna agent orchestrates MacroFlow phases, but users need clearer signals for phase transitions to maintain flow and awareness. Previous iterations lacked explicit guidance, leading to confusion in long sessions. This builds on the updated Constitution and Clarify instructions for role-based requirements capture.  
**Decision**: Add a "Guiding Users Through Phases with Labels" section to Luna.agent.md, defining transition labels (e.g., [Constitution Complete]) and updating Default Behavior to use them. This ensures structured progression without disrupting Grok-native flow.  
**Consequences**:

- Positive: Enhances user experience by sparking phase awareness, reduces errors in multi-step processes, aligns with MacroFlow's iterative improvement via real-world examples like MacroFlow-Analysis.md.
- Negative: Adds slight verbosity to responses; requires testing to ensure labels don't overwhelm short queries.

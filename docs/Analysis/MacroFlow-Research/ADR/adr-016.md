### ADR 016: Define Key Architectural Patterns for Luna Foundry API Development

**Date**: January 7, 2026  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Context**: Luna Foundry needs consistent patterns for API development across scales. Larger enterprise needs CQRS/MediatR; others use Minimal API/Repository/Specification; quick turns use Azure Functions. ADO setup requires PAT for access.  
**Decision**: Adopt CQRS/MediatR for enterprise, Minimal API/Repository/Specification for general, Azure Functions for quick; require PAT for ADO auth. Update agents to enforce.  
**Consequences**:  
- Positive: Consistent, scalable APIs; secure ADO access.  
- Negative: Learning curve for patterns; PAT management overhead.

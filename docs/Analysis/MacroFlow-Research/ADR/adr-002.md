# ADR 002: Separate Development and Deployment for Agents

**Date**: 2026-01-03  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: To enable iterative development of custom agents in the Luna Foundry
while ensuring safe testing and deployment, we need to distinguish between
building agents in the repository and publishing them for VS Code Copilot use.
Previous approaches mixed development and deployment, risking untested changes.  
**Decision**: Develop agents, instructions, prompts, and skills in `src/foundry`,
then deploy finalized versions to the local `~/.github` folder for Copilot
discovery and testing.  
**Consequences**:

- Positive: Allows version-controlled iteration in the repo, with lightweight
deployment for validation.
- Negative: Requires manual sync steps; potential for drift if not synced
properly.

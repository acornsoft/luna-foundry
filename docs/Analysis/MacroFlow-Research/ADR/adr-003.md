# ADR 003: Adopt Hybrid Markdown/JSON for Agents

**Date**: 2026-01-03  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: VS Code Copilot custom agents use Markdown for definitions, while
structured integrations (e.g., MCP/tools) require JSON. Previous assumptions
based on Microsoft 365 agents (JSON-only) did not align with VS Code standards,
leading to potential incompatibility.  
**Decision**: Use Markdown files for agent definitions, instructions, prompts,
and skills in `src/foundry`, with JSON for MCP server configs and tool
integrations.  
**Consequences**:

- Positive: Aligns with VS Code customization, enables flexible agent creation
and portable skills.
- Negative: Requires dual-format knowledge; JSON adds complexity for
integrations.

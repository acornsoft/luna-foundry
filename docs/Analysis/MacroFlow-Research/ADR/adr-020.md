# ADR 020: Apply Requirements-Writing Skill to Luna Foundry Release 1 Epic

**Date**: 2026-01-10  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: The Requirements-Writing skill has been fully developed with sub-skills for the complete ADO work item hierarchy (Epic > Feature > Requirement > User Story > Task > Test Case). To validate and demonstrate the skill, it was applied to the top-level Epic (ID 973: Luna Foundry (Release 1)) in Azure DevOps via MCP tools. The Epic description was refined with structured sections (Business Objectives, Key Objectives, etc.), verbose content (400+ words), testable acceptance criteria, and MacroFlow integration. The field format was set to Markdown for better editing. Additionally, Requirements-Writer was added as a key skill in the Luna Foundry README.md for Release 1 documentation.  
**Decision**: Apply the Requirements-Writing skill to update the Epic work item with a comprehensive, skill-compliant description in Markdown format. Document the application in MacroFlow-Analysis.md and generate this ADR to capture the changes. Ensure work items reflect the refined requirements for traceability.  
**Consequences**:  

- Positive: Epic now exemplifies high-quality, testable requirements; skill validation successful; improved documentation and traceability in ADO and GitHub.  
- Negative: Potential overhead in maintaining detailed descriptions; requires ongoing skill updates for evolving patterns.  
- Neutral: Aligns with MacroFlow Specify phase for requirements refinement.

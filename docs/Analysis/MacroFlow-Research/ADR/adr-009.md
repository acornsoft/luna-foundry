# ADR 009: Integrate MacroFlow into GitHub Copilot via Repo Instructions

**Date**: 2026-01-06  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: GitHub Copilot in VS Code defaults to generic suggestions without enforcing our MacroFlow ritual, leading to inconsistent AI outputs. We need repo-level customization to embed Luna's personality and phases for all contributors.  
**Decision**: Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` at the repo root, containing MacroFlow phases, Grok-native constraints, and neutral phrasing to avoid refusals. This file will auto-influence Copilot suggestions and chats.  
**Consequences**:  
- Positive: Ensures MacroFlow enforcement in Copilot, reducing drift and improving quality.  
- Negative: Requires manual file creation and may not override all defaults; potential for verbose instructions.

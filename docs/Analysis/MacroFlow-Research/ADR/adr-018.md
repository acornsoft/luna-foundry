### ADR 018: Ensure Prerequisites and Azure DevOps Access in Constitution Phase

**Date**: 2026-01-09  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Constitution phase loads manifesto and checks setup, but must also verify prerequisites (VS Code, PowerShell, Node.js, etc.) and access to Azure DevOps via MCP Server (acornsoftDevOpsServer in mcp.json) for work item integration. This ensures Luna Foundry can track progress and link artifacts in ADO.  
**Decision**: Update Constitution skill and process to include prerequisite checks and ADO access verification at startup, using MCP for authentication and queries.  
**Consequences**:  
- Positive: Reliable setup, seamless ADO integration for work items and artifacts.  
- Negative: Adds initial overhead, requires MCP configuration.

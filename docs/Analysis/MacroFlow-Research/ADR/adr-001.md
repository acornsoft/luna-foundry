# ADR 001: Adopt MacroFlow Phases

**Date**: 2026-01-01  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: The Luna Foundry requires a structured process for developing prompts
and agents to ensure consistency and alignment with Grok xAI constraints.
Previous ad-hoc methods led to inconsistencies.  
**Decision**: Implement MacroFlow with six phases: Constitution, Clarify,
Specify, Plan, Tasks, Implement.  
**Consequences**:

- Positive: Standardized process reduces errors and improves quality.
- Negative: May add overhead for simple tasks; requires training.

# ADR 004: Add Forensic Coder Skill for Codebase Analysis

**Date**: 2026-01-03  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: The Luna Foundry needs capabilities for comprehensive codebase analysis to support client-based analysis and solution development. Existing tools lack integrated, Grok-first forensic analysis across security, performance, and design aspects.  
**Decision**: Implement the Forensic Coder as a Skill in `src/foundry/skills/forensic-coder/`, including Markdown definitions, JSON prompts, and tool configs for MCP integrations.  
**Consequences**:  

- Positive: Enables thorough, truth-seeking code analysis during Clarify/Specify phases; reusable for multiple projects.  
- Negative: Requires setup of analysis tools; may increase complexity for simple reviews.

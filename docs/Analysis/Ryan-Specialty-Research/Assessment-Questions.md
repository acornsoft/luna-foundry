# Ryan Specialty - M&A Framework Agreement: Power Platform Assessment Questions

**Project**: AVA: Ryan Specialty - M&A Framework Agreement  
**Client**: Ryan Specialty (acquiring company)  
**Focus**: Assessment of acquired company's Power Platform solution for migration to Ryan Specialty's M365/Azure tenant.  
**Stage**: Sales Assessment (pre-project, February start)  
**Date**: January 12, 2026  
**Prepared by**: Luna Foundry (MacroFlow Clarify Phase)

## Overview
These questions are designed to gather critical information for the sales assessment, enabling us to understand the scope, risks, and value proposition of the Power Platform migration. They align with MacroFlow's Clarify phase, focusing on current state, target state, and migration architecture. Responses will inform the proposal and project plan.

## Current State Assessment Questions

### Power Platform Components

1. What specific Power Platform components are currently in use in the acquired company's solution? (e.g., Power Apps, Power Automate flows, Power BI reports, Dataverse entities, custom connectors)
2. Are there any integrations with external systems (e.g., APIs, third-party services, on-premises databases)? Please list them and describe their criticality.
3. What is the complexity level of the Power Apps (e.g., canvas vs. model-driven, number of screens/forms)?
4. How many Power Automate flows exist, and what triggers them (e.g., manual, scheduled, event-based)?
5. Are there any custom connectors or plugins developed for this solution?

### Microsoft 365 and SharePoint Integration

6. How is SharePoint Online integrated (e.g., document libraries, lists, sites used by Power Apps/Automate)?
7. Is M365 CoPilot used in the solution? If so, how (e.g., in Power Apps, for data analysis)?
8. What security and compliance features are implemented (e.g., data loss prevention, retention policies)?

### Technical Environment

9. What is the current M365 tenant setup (e.g., licensing, regions, custom domains)?
10. Are there any dependencies on legacy systems or non-Microsoft technologies?
11. What is the estimated data volume (e.g., Dataverse records, SharePoint storage)?

## Target State Requirements Questions

### Ryan Specialty Tenant Standards

12. What are the key standards in Ryan Specialty's M365/Azure tenant (e.g., naming conventions, security policies, compliance requirements like GDPR/HIPAA)?
13. Are there existing Power Platform governance policies (e.g., environment management, approval workflows)?
14. What integrations or standards must the migrated solution adhere to (e.g., SSO, Azure AD groups)?

### Business Requirements

15. What are the must-have features post-migration (e.g., enhanced productivity, cost savings)?
16. Are there any business process changes planned alongside the migration?
17. What success metrics are defined (e.g., uptime, user adoption, performance benchmarks)?

## Migration Architecture and Process Questions

### Migration Strategy

18. What is the preferred migration approach (e.g., phased rollout, big-bang, hybrid)?
19. Are there any constraints on downtime or data migration windows?
20. What tools or services will be used for migration (e.g., Power Platform admin center, Azure DevOps pipelines)?

### Risks and Dependencies

21. What potential risks have been identified (e.g., data loss, integration failures, user training needs)?
22. Who are the key stakeholders and teams involved (e.g., IT, business users, acquired company reps)?
23. What dependencies exist (e.g., other M&A integrations, regulatory approvals)?

## Additional Questions

24. What documentation is available (e.g., architecture diagrams, user manuals, code repositories)?
25. What is the timeline expectation for the full project (assessment to go-live)?
26. Are there any budget or resource constraints to consider?

## Next Steps

- Compile responses into a structured analysis using MacroFlow Specify phase.
- Develop proposal with high-level plan, risks, and ROI.
- Schedule follow-up meetings for clarifications.

# Tasks Skill

## Overview

The Tasks phase breaks down the plan into vertical slices, user stories, and concrete tasks.

## Purpose

- Decompose plan into actionable items
- Create user stories and tasks
- Prioritize work
- Track progress

## Inputs

- Implementation plan
- Architecture decisions

## Process

1. Break down into vertical slices
2. Define user stories
3. Create concrete tasks
4. Assign priorities and estimates

## Outputs

- Task breakdown
- User stories
- Sprint backlog

## Grok Integration

Use Grok for task decomposition and prioritization. Temperature: 0.3 for structured output.

## Next Phase

Proceed to Implement when tasks are defined.

## Instructions

1. Create task graph.
2. Vertical slices.

## Examples

- Input: Plan.
- Output: Concrete tasks.

## Learned Patterns

- User stories.

853529,Feature,,,,Integration: Prospect to Customer Setup Process Enablement via CLM (R2),,,,,"This feature will enable CRM to integrate directly with CLM APIs for the prospect-to-customer setup process as part of the One Customer Initiative. Today, during R1, Sales Ops would use their judgement to prevent duplicates in CRM and enter data into MDM via CLM UI manually. After the Sales Representative indicates that the prospect is ready to be converted to customer via the Dynamics CRM UI, Sales Operations (ops Admin) these as customer in CLM UI manually  which in turn triggers a transaction to MDM to start the customer setup process.
 

 
In R2, the process will shift to automation:
 

 *  Prospects created in CRM will automatically be validated, deduplicated, and processed via CLM (MDM) APIs. 
 *  Upon conversion, the Base Customer Account (BCA) and linked sales skill accounts will be updated seamlessly in CRM. 
 *  Duplicate checks will evolve to support the new sales skill model, ensuring no duplicate creation and enabling “add sales skill” scenarios. 
 *  CRM users will benefit from fewer manual steps, reduced risk of errors, and stronger alignment with MDM/EBS master data. 
 

 
Key Changes Introduced 

 *  Automate prospect creation flow between CRM ? CLM ? MDM. 
 *  Automate prospect-to-customer conversion by consuming CLM APIs directly. 
 *  Enhance duplicate check logic to align with sales skill model (multiple sales skills per site/address). 
 *  Support a new “add sales skill” integration path to append sales skills to existing customers. 
 *  Maintain CRM/MDM/EBS alignment using the Base Customer Account as the anchor identifier. 
 *  Provide clear ID and status synchronization across all systems (CRM, CLM, MDM, and EBS). 
 

 
High-Level Business Requirements 

 *  Automated Prospect Processing 

 *  When a prospect is created in CRM, the record must be automatically sent to MDM through CLM APIs for validation, duplicate check, and ID assignment. 
 

 *  Seamless Conversion to Customer 

 *  Upon prospect approval and conversion in CLM, the BCA and sales skill accounts in CRM must be automatically updated with the new ERP/MDM identifiers and ERP status set to Customer. 
 

 *  Duplicate Detection & Sales Skill Handling 

 *  If a duplicate is found, CRM must receive feedback from CLM to either: 

 *  Block creation of a new prospect, or 
 *  Create a new sales skill under an existing customer BCA. 
 

 

 *  Add Sales Skill Support 

 *  Provide integration path for CRM ? CLM ? MDM when a rep or Sales Ops adds a new sales skill to an existing customer account. 
 

 *  ID & Status Synchronization 

 *  CRM must maintain consistent BCAID, Sales Skill IDs, and ERP system identifiers across MDM/EBS/CLM. 
 *  ERP status transitions (prospect ? customer) must flow automatically into CRM. 
 

 *  User Experience Improvements 

 *  Eliminate manual form submissions (Ops Admin, emails). 
 *  Ensure CRM users see accurate prospect/customer statuses without requiring back-and-forth with Sales Ops. 
 

 *  Future-Proofing 

 *  Follow the CLM API roadmap to ensure a single-pass, simplified process in later releases. 
 *  Build flexibility for additional validations (address normalization, fuzzy match, etc.) to be applied via MDM.

853534,Requirement,,,,,Consume CLM API Responses to Handle Duplicates and Add Sales Skills,,,,"Business Objective:
Enable CRM to intelligently respond to CLM/MDM validation outcomes during prospect creation. When a duplicate is detected, CRM must either block the creation of a new record or seamlessly trigger the addition of a new sales skill to the existing customer/prospect. This ensures data integrity, prevents duplicate accounts, and supports multi–sales skill structures in line with the One Customer model. 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  During prospect creation in CRM: 

 *  Duplicate Check via CLM API: 

 *  CRM sends prospect data (name, address, district, sales skill). 
 

 *  CLM/MDM responds with one of three outcomes: 

 *  No match found ? Prospect creation proceeds as new Prospect BCA + Sales Skill Account. 
 *  Duplicate prospect found ? CRM blocks new creation, and user must use existing prospect record. 
 *  Existing customer found ? CRM must allow rep/ops to add a new sales skill to the existing BCA. 
 

 

 *  Blocking Rules: 

 *  Duplicate creation attempts must be stopped before a new P-number or BCA is assigned. 
 *  A clear message should guide the rep to the existing record. 
 

 *  Add Sales Skill Flow: 

 *  If CLM response indicates “existing customer,” CRM should trigger the “Add Sales Skill” process: 
 *  Create a new Sales Skill Account under the existing BCA. 
 *  Ensure correct linkage between BCA, Sales Skill Account, and ERP identifiers. 
 *  Status initially set to Pending Review until approved by Sales Ops (R2 automation). 
 

 *  Business Ownership: 

 *  Sales Ops retains authority to review final duplicate resolution in CRM. 
 *  Reps are prevented from bypassing the duplicate check by manually creating accounts. 
 

 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  CRM must consume and parse CLM API response codes for duplicates and matches. 
 *  Ensure synchronous handling so that users get immediate feedback on duplicate attempts. 
 *  Error scenarios: 

 *  If API fails or times out, fallback rule = prospect saved in Pending Review, flagged for Sales Ops review. 
 

 *  Mapping required between CLM-provided IDs and CRM IDs for record linking. 
 *  Ensure that “Add Sales Skill” triggered from CLM response is logged with traceability (audit trail). 
 *  Need to align with existing “Add Sales Skill” button logic to avoid duplicative implementations. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  CRM integrated with CLM duplicate-check API during prospect creation. 
 *  Automated handling of three outcomes: new prospect, duplicate block, or add sales skill. 
 *  Prevent duplicate account proliferation by enforcing CLM response logic. 
 *  Ability to expand existing customers with additional sales skills without creating duplicate accounts. 
 *  Documentation of response handling, error fallback, and process ownership. 
 *  Test scenarios covering: 
 *  No match (new prospect creation). 
 *  Duplicate prospect (blocked). 
 *  Existing customer (add sales skill).

853533,Requirement,,,,,"Automate Prospect-to-Customer Conversion Across CRM, CLM, MDM, and EBS",,,,"Business Objective:
Ensure seamless conversion of approved prospects into active customers by synchronizing CRM with CLM, MDM, and EBS. When a prospect is approved in CLM, the corresponding CRM records (Prospect BCA and linked Sales Skill accounts) must automatically update with the official ERP customer number and correct ERP status, eliminating manual intervention and ensuring system-wide consistency. 

 

 
Business Requirements:
 

 *  When Sales Ops approves a prospect in CLM: 

 *  CLM triggers the conversion process by sending details to MDM. 
 *  MDM processes the request and passes it to EBS for official customer account creation. 
 *  EBS generates the ERP customer number and returns it to MDM, which then flows back to CLM and CRM. 
 

 *  In CRM, the following updates must occur automatically: 

 *  Prospect BCA: 

 *  ERP Status flips from Prospect ? Customer. 
 *  ERP Customer Number is populated. 
 

 *  Sales Skill Accounts linked to the Prospect BCA: 

 *  Account Type flips from Prospect ? Customer. 
 *  ERP Customer Number is populated on each linked account. 
 

 *  Ownership: Updated to reflect any new ownership logic coming from CLM/MDM. 
 

 *  
 
 *  Status transitions must be fully automated with no manual updates in CRM. 
 *  All related downstream entities (opportunities, contacts, service records) must retain their links to the updated Customer accounts. 
 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  CRM must consume CLM/MDM integration events that include the official ERP Customer Number and updated status. 
 *  Update logic in CRM must ensure both the BCA and all linked Sales Skill Accounts remain synchronized. 
 *  Error handling: 

 *  If an ERP number is not received, the conversion should not complete in CRM. 
 *  Partial updates must be avoided; CRM should roll back or retry until successful. 
 

 *  Data mapping must include: 

 *  Prospect BCA ? Customer BCA. 
 *  Prospect ERP Status ? Customer ERP Status. 
 *  Sales Skill Account Type ? Customer. 
 *  ERP Number population at both BCA and Sales Skill levels. 
 

 *  Ownership sync: Clarify whether CRM should always overwrite ownership from CLM/MDM or allow manual override. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Automated prospect-to-customer conversion process integrated across CRM, CLM, MDM, and EBS. 
 *  CRM records (BCA and Sales Skill accounts) automatically updated with ERP numbers and status changes. 
 *  ERP Status transitions (Prospect ? Customer) reflected consistently in both BCA and Sales Skill accounts. 
 *  Documentation of integration mapping, status transitions, and test cases. 
 *  Error-handling and retry mechanism for failed updates.

I want to assess EIN formatting requirements (including leading zeros) and analyze downstream impacts of any normalization or data fix,
 
so that we can confidently pass a correct EIN to CLM and maintain consistency across CRM and dependent systems.
 

 
Background: 

 *  CRM will pass the rep’s EIN / Workday Employee ID (stored on System User as ECL_EmployeeId) as part of the CLM Launch context. We have identified potential data quality issues where some EIN values that should include leading zeros may be stored in CRM without them (e.g., 00123456 stored as 123456). Workday EIN length can vary (currently observed 6–8 digits), which creates ambiguity on whether CRM should: 

 *  Normalize at runtime (pad with leading zeros to 8 characters only when sending to CLM), or 
 *  Clean the source data in CRM (update user records to match the authoritative Workday/EBS source), with governance and downstream impact validation. 
 

 *  Before choosing an approach, we need to confirm: 

 *  the authoritative source and expected canonical format (exact string as Workday stores it) 
 *  if CRM and downstream systems (Power BI, integrations, reports, security mapping, etc.) assume a specific EIN format/length 
 *  whether leading-zero updates could break joins, historical reporting, or identity mapping 
 

 

Spike Objective
 
 

 *  Determine the correct EIN format and the safest remediation approach (runtime normalization vs. CRM data fix), including downstream impact analysis, and produce a recommended implementation plan.

 *  Current-state assessment of SystemUser.ECL_EmployeeId: 

 *  field type, max length, nullability, usage 
 *  frequency of EIN values by length (6/7/8) and suspected missing leading zeros 
 *  the team should document: 

 *  field schema (type, length, required/optional) 
 *  sample data patterns (6/7/8 digits, alphanumeric if any) 
 *  count of users by EIN length 
 *  count of suspected “missing leading zero” cases (based on comparison logic or authoritative source workday) 
 

 

 *  Determine canonical EIN representation: 

 *  confirm if Workday treats EIN as a string identifier (not numeric) 
 *  confirm whether leading zeros are meaningful and must be preserved 
 

 *  Evaluate solution approaches: 

 *  Option A: runtime normalization when building CLM token (e.g., pad-left to 8 only when appropriate) 
 *  Option B: one-time CRM data cleanup to correct stored EIN values to match authoritative system 
 

 *  Downstream impact assessment. Create an Inventory List: 

 *  each dependent system/artifact (Power BI datasets/reports, integrations, Snowflake views, ADF pipelines, etc.) 
 *  how EIN is used (join key, display field, filter, export) 
 *  risk rating per dependency (Low/Med/High) 
 *  required remediation per dependency if EIN format changes 
 

 *  Produce recommendation + implementation plan + risks 

 *  preferred approach (Option A or Option B, or hybrid)

Background: 
 

 *  To support secure launch of CLM from CRM without exposing PII (e.g., rep email/EIN) in URL query parameters, we will implement a tokenized launch pattern where CRM generates an encrypted token (primary approach: AES-GCM) and appends only the token to the CLM launch URL. CLM will decrypt the token server-side and route the user to the correct account. 
 *  Attached is a working AES-GCM console sample that demonstrates encryption/decryption and (optionally) token expiry logic. This spike is to prove the CRM implementation path (Ribbon button ? JS ? Custom API/Action/Plugin ? token ? URL launch) and to finalize key storage best practices.

 *  In the One Customer (1C) model, customer creation and sales skill expansion are executed in CLM after Sales Ops approval in CRM. 
 *  CRM is the system of record for: 

 *  Prospect approval 
 *  Sales skill setup 
 *  BCA relationships 
 *  MDM identifiers 
 

 *  CLM is the system of execution for: 

 *  Customer creation 
 *  Adding sales skills to existing customers 
 

 *  To avoid manual searching and reduce errors, CRM must provide a Launch CLM action that passes sufficient context to CLM. CRM does not perform customer conversion logic; it only initiates the process and tracks outcomes returned by CLM and MDM. 
 

 
This story covers only CRM responsibilities.

As a Sales Operations user
I want a CRM view that clearly lists all approved 1C prospects that are eligible for customer conversion
 
So that I can efficiently identify, filter, and prioritize prospects that are ready to be converted to customers using CLM, without manually inspecting multiple records.
 

 
Business Context / Background 

 *  In the One Customer (1C) model, prospect-to-customer conversion is a controlled Sales Ops–led process. Only prospects that have completed address validation, duplicate checks, Sales Ops approval, and MDM onboarding are eligible for customer conversion. 
 *  This user story introduces a dedicated operational queue—“1C – Prospects Ready for Customer Conversion”—that serves as the single source of truth for Sales Ops to identify and act on eligible prospects. 
 *  This view is a prerequisite for the CLM launch action implemented in a subsequent user story.

853531,Requirement,,,,,"Automate prospect creation flow in CRM ? CLM ? MDM with API payloads for address validation, duplicate check, and ID return.",,,,"Business Objective:
Enable CRM to automatically integrate with CLM/MDM during the creation of a new prospect, so that address validation, duplicate checking, and unique ID assignment are performed in real-time. This ensures higher data quality, prevents duplicate records, and establishes a consistent customer identity across CRM, CLM, and MDM from the first point of entry. 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  When a prospect is created in CRM, the record must be automatically sent to CLM/MDM via the CLM API. 
 *  CLM/MDM must perform: 

 *  Address validation to ensure standardization and accuracy. 
 *  Duplicate check against MDM to confirm whether this is a new prospect or an existing record. 
 *  ID return to provide a unique MDM identifier for valid new prospects. 
 

 *  If the duplicate check determines a match: 

 *  CRM must not create a new prospect record but should instead flag the scenario for Sales Ops review. 
 

 *  If no duplicate is found: 

 *  A prospect BCA is created in CRM and linked with the returned MDM ID. 
 

 *  The process should be fully automated, minimizing Sales Ops manual interventions at the point of prospect entry. 
 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  CRM must consume the CLM API endpoints for address validation, duplicate check, and ID return (API orchestration may be needed if APIs are separate). 
 *  Data mapping of CRM fields (prospect name, address, sales skill, district) to CLM/MDM API payload must be defined. 
 *  Response handling logic must be built in CRM: 

 *  Success (new prospect ? ID assigned). 
 *  Duplicate (block creation + flag for review). 
 *  Error (API failure ? clear error message to user). 
 

 *  Audit trail of API requests/responses should be logged for traceability. 
 *  Performance testing required to ensure responsiveness does not slow down prospect creation. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Automated prospect creation workflow in CRM integrated with CLM APIs. 
 *  Standardized address and duplicate check validations running during prospect save. 
 *  Automatic creation of a Prospect BCA in CRM with the returned MDM ID and P-number. 
 *  Error-handling framework and user-friendly messages for failed API responses. 
 *  Documentation of API payload mapping and test scenarios.

 *  Given a sales rep creates or edits a prospect and clicks Save

 *  Consistency Across All Prospect Entry Points

 *  Given a prospect is in Pending Approval status 

 *  When a Sales Ops user opens the prospect form 
 *  Then the MDM Validation section must appear under the Account form under the address section (only for 1C accounts). 
 

 *  Given the logged-in user is not Sales Ops 

 *  When viewing the prospect 
 *  Then the MDM Validation section must remain hidden. 
 

 *  Given the MDM Validation section loads 

 *  When fields and controls are rendered 
 *  Then the section must contain the following elements in the Summary Tab after Address Section: 

 *  Address Validation Control Button 
 *  Address Validation Status Icon (Green check = complete / Orange clock = not completed) 
 *  MDM Duplicate Check Button (Search API trigger) 
 

 

 *  Given the SalesOps navigates to the Admin tab, the admin tab must contain the following elements added: 

 *  Fields: Address Verified, Address Verification Bypassed, Is Duplicate Check Completed, Duplicate Check User Selection, MDM ID, Account Number, MDM Number 
 

 

 

 *  Address Validation Behavior in Sales Ops (This is already covered as part of #890506) So no additional dev work is needed for the Address validation required mentioned in the AC)  

 *  Given the Address Validation step was not completed by Sales Rep  

 *  When Sales Ops opens the prospect  
 *  Then Address Validation button must show an orange clock indicator meaning it is not completed  
 

 *  Given Sales Ops clicks Address Validation  

 *  When the MDM Address Validation API returns standardized address results  
 *  Then CRM must display a model window showing address suggestions with:  

 *  Standardized Address Line 1  
 *  City  
 *  State/Province  
 *  Postal Code  
 *  Country  
 

 

 *  Given Sales Ops selects a standardized address  

 *  When they confirm  
 *  Then CRM must:  

 *  Update address fields with selected standardized values  
 *  Set Address Verified = Yes (In Admin tab)  
 *  Set Address Verification Bypassed = No (In Admin Tab)  
 *  Display a green checkmark next to the Address Validation control.  
 

 

 *  Given no results are returned from Address Validation  

 *  When Sales Ops chooses to bypass  
 *  Then CRM sets  

 *  Address Verification Bypassed = Yes.  (In Admin tab)  
 *  Set Address Verified = No.  (In Admin tab)  
 *  Continue to display orange pending indicator against the address validation button 
 

 

 

 *  MDM Duplicate Check / Search Action – Sales Ops Only 

 *  Given Address Validation status is green 

 *  When Sales Ops is viewing the MDM Validation section 
 *  Then the MDM Duplicate Check Button must be visible and enabled. 
 

 *  Given Sales Ops clicks the MDM Duplicate Check button 

 *  When CRM invokes the API via plugin. (The Plugin call the MDM Search API) 
 *  Then results must appear in a modal window. 
 

 

 *  MDM Duplicate/Search Modal – Required Columns 

 *  Given the modal window appears 
 *  When one or more MDM candidates are returned 
 *  Then each row must show the following columns: 

 *  MDM Account Name   
 *  Source Account Number  
 *  MDM Account ID  
 *  Division   
 *  Customer Status Code (Active/Inactive)  
 *  Sales Skill
  
 *  Once Customer Flag (Yes /No) - OneCustomerERP  
 *  Address Line 1  
 *  City,   
 *  State/Province,   
 *  Postal Code  
 *  Country 
 *  Score 
 *  CRM ID 
 

 

 *  Pre-filtered retrieval logic. This ensures SalesOps only interacts with actionable data: 

 *  Strict Filtering: Only retrieve records where SourceID = ECL_EBS. 
 *  Hardstop Logic: The retrieved records will include all results including Hardstop = Y as well as Hardstop = N 
 *  Override Capability: If the retrieved results have hardstop = Y and division = 20 (Food & beverage) then this override capability is NOT applicable. The modal will continue to display all remaining results where hardstop = N. 
 *  Sorting & Prioritization: Results will be sorted in descending order by Match Score to ensure the most relevant records appear first. 
 *  UI Updates: The radio buttons for selection should only be shown for the results where division = 20 (food & beverage), the sales ops should not be able to select results from other division. 
 

 


 

 *  Given multiple MDM matches exist 

 *  When the modal displays them 
 *  Then rows must be sortable by Score in Descending order. 
 

 *  Given the API returns no results 

 *  When the modal opens 
 *  Then CRM must show: 

 *  “No duplicates found in MDM. This prospect will be auto-approved after clicking Save.” 
 

 

 

 *  Sales Ops Action –

 *  Cancel --> Close the modal, No data changes, gives opportunity to SalesOps to make any required updates on the Account form 
 

 *  Merge, Reject or linking action buttons are not shown to the SalesOps at this point. 
 

 *  No Matches Found 

 *  Given the modal window appears 
 *  When no matches are found 
 *  Sales Ops has two button options: 

 *  Proceed --> On clicking the Proceed button, Prospect will be auto approved and send to MDM 

 *  When the Prospect is saved, the CRM system must: 
 *  Set IsDuplicateCheckCompleted = Yes 
 *  Set DuplicateCheckUserSelection = “No Duplicate Found” 
 *  Trigger IF10 Prospect Create (Requirement covered in story User Story 892571: CRM – Invoke MDM Prospect Creation post MDM Dup Check) 

 

 

 

 *  Cancel --> Close the modal, No data changes, gives opportunity to SalesOps to make any required updates on the Account form 
 

 

 *  *Proceed 

 *  Given the SalesOps clicks on 'Proceed' after Possible Matches are found 
 *  Then the CRM system evaluates the selected MDM match against the current prospect 

 *  Outcome A: Selected Match has different Sales Skills than the newly added Prospect  

 *  Given that the Selected Match has different Sales Skill than the newly added prospect (Current=Water, Selected Match=Hygiene) 
 *  Then the system will show a modal window 

 *  With message --> “A matching prospect was found with adifferent Sales Skill. Recommended action: link this prospect to the existingaccount ” 
 *  Current Prospect Sales Skill 
 *  Select Match Sales Skill  
 *  BCA Name (if available) 
 

 *  And will have buttons:

 *  Update CRM.MDMID = MDM.MDMID
   
 *  Update the Account Number as MDM Account Number  
 *  ERP Account Status = Prospect if MDM Customer Status is 02 Prospect | Active if MDM Customer Status is 01 Active 
 *  Account Type = Customer if MDM Customer Status is 01 Active 
 *  Set Approval Status = Approved  
 *  Set Worked By =  LOGGED IN USER  
 *  Set Approval Comment = “Auto-approved – No duplicates found in MDM.” 
 

 

 *  Cancel --> Cancels the modal and returns to Possible Matches Found modal window. 
 

 

 *  Outcome B: Selected Match with same sales skill that may or may not have related entities. 

 *  Given that the Selected Match has same Sales Skill as the current Prospect  
 *  Covered in a separate story for 'Reject' & 'Merge' scenarios #897278 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 *  UI Behavior & Control Visibility Rules 

 *  Given the prospect is pending approval 

 *  When Sales Ops opens the record 
 *  Then both Address Validation and MDM Duplicate Check buttons must be enabled. 
 

 *  Given the prospect is already approved or rejected 

 *  When Sales Ops opens the form 
 *  Then buttons must be disabled in read-only mode. 
 

 *  Given a sales rep opens the prospect 

 *  Then MDM Duplicate Check/Search button must be hidden (Sales Ops only). 
 

 

 *  Data Integrity Rules 

 *  Linking CRM ? MDM must never create a second BCA. 
 *  Existing PCA/BCA relationships must be preserved unless explicitly overridden by Sales Ops selection. 
 *  IF10 messages must always reflect the correct operation: 

 *  New prospect ? create 
 *  New sales skill ? add skill 
 *  Existing MDM match ? update only 
 

 

 *  Error Handling 

 *  Given the MDM Search/Dupe API is unreachable 

 *  When Sales Ops triggers the duplicate check 
 *  Then CRM must: 

 *  Display message: “MDM service unavailable. Please try again or route prospect for manual review.” 
 *  Not approve automatically 
 *  Leave Approval Status = Pending 
 *  Leave MDM ID blank 
 

 

 

 

Note: When New fields are created to support this feature, please ensure you refer to this story to know the list of fields that needs to be created. #890505
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Global Option Set Field Creation on the Account Table 

 *  Given CRM must store duplicate check decisions (Create Duplicate Check User Selection field on Account Table) 

 *  When the Duplicate Check User Selection option set is created 
 *  Then it must contain: 

 *  No Duplicate Found 
 *  I Will Use Existing Account 
 *  Reject - Duplicate Found 
 *  And no default value must be set. 
 

 

 *  Given CRM must track completion of duplicate checks  (Create Is Duplicate Check Completed field on Account Table) 

 *  When the Is Duplicate Check Completed option set is created 
 *  Then it must contain Yes / No, with no default value, and will be maintained only by automated processes.

Scenario 4B - No Matches Found

 
1.Validate? when MDM returns no matches
 
 
2.Validate two button options are visible in Modal window
 

 *  Proceed --> On clicking the Proceed button, Prospect will be auto approved and send to MDM 
 *  When the Prospect is saved, the CRM system must: 

 *  Set IsDuplicateCheckCompleted = Yes 
 *  Set DuplicateCheckUserSelection = “No Duplicate Found” 

 

 

 

 *  Cancel --> Close the modal, No data changes, gives opportunity to SalesOps to make any required updates on the Account form 
 

 
Scenario 5A: Proceed button functionality >Selected Match has different Sales Skills than the newly added Prospect

1.Validate When SalesOps clicks on 'Proceed' after Possible Matches are found
2.When user Selects Match has different Sales Skill than the newly added prospect (Current=Water, Selected Match=Hygiene)        
 

 *  Validate Then the system will show a modal window 

 *  With message --> “A matching prospect was found with a different Sales Skill. Recommended action: link this prospect to the existing account ” 
 *  Current Prospect Sales Skill 
 *  Select Match Sales Skill  
 *  BCA Name (if available) 
 

 *  And also validate these buttons: 

 *  Confirm Link --> CRM links the current prospect to identified BCA 

 *  Update Audit/Log fields: 

 *  Update IsDuplicateCheckCompleted = Yes 
 *  Update DuplicateCheckUserSelection = ""Duplicates Found"" 
 *  Update CRM.MDMID = MDM.MDMID
 
 *  Update the Account Number as MDM Account Number 
 *  ERP Account Status = Prospect if MDM Customer Status is 02 Prospect | Active if MDM Customer Status is 01 Active 
 *  Account Type = Customer if MDM Customer Status is 01 Active 
 *  Set Approval Status = Approved 
 *  Set Worked By =  LOGGED IN USER 
 *  Set Approval Comment = “Auto-approved – No duplicates found in MDM.” 
 

 

 *  Cancel --> Cancels the modal and returns to Possible Matches Found modal window

890508,User Story,,,,,,CRM – Implement Pre-save CRM Duplicate Check on Prospect (Standardized Address + Sales Skill),,," 
As a sales rep, I want CRM to perform an internal duplicate checkin the background on prospect save using standardized address and sales skillso that obvious duplicates already in CRM are caught early without Sales Repmaking decision on merge or ignore the duplicates. 
 

 *  Cutover     Plan: 

 *  This      solution requires cutover activity to standardize all the addresses in      CRM system for prospects & customers 
 *  This      requires IT & Business involved and has been documented in user story      895455 & 895456 
 *  This will standardize      addresses and resolve duplicates for Canada 1C-scope prospects in CRM so      there are clean prospect with address & sales skill in the system 
 

 *  On     prospect save (Quick Create and full form), Rep will need to click on     Address Validation: 

 *  Possible      Outcomes: 

 *  Address       Validated Successfully from MDM 
 *  Address       Bypass  (Either invalid address or       API unreachable) 
 

 *  If Address Validation is      successful, CRM system will trigger CRM dup check on: 

 *  Standardized       address (as validated via MDM). 
 *  Sales       skill (for 1C prospects). 
 

 *  Possible     CRM outcomes: 

 *  Duplicates      found --> Prospect will not be saved 
 *  No match      found ? CRM will trigger MDM duplicate check. 

 *  Duplicates       found --> Prospect is saved with pending approval status 
 *  No match       found -->  Prospect is saved       with auto approval status 
 

 

 

 *  Use custom plugin on pre-save for CRM duplicate detection rules on standardized address and sales skill for     1C accounts in the background 
 *  Ensure     behavior is consistent whether the prospect was created from Quick Create,     account form. 
 

 

 
","Babu, Ganesh",Pending PO Review,CodeReviewed; CRM,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.17.04,2,Moved out of state In Test,Business,26," *  Triggering     pre-save CRM Duplicate Check using Plugin 

 *  Given a      sales rep creates or edits a 1C Prospect using QuickCreate or the full      Account form 

 *  When the       user clicks Save or Save &       Close or Save & Create New 
 *  Then CRM       must automatically perform a pre-save CRM       duplicate check (using custom Plugin to check against 1C accounts only) 
 *  And the       duplicate check must use: 

 *  Standardized        address fields (Street, City, State/Province, Postal Code, Country) -        Exact Match  
 *  Sales        Skill - Exact Match (The list of fields should be made configurable so that this can be adjusted if we need to check on sales skill at a later date/demo) 
 *  And only on Active Account Records. 
 

 

 

 *  Duplicate     Found — Prospect will NOT be saved in the CRM system 

 *  Given the      duplicate check finds one or more matching CRM accounts/prospects on      pre-save 

 *  When the       system finds a duplicate record in the CRM system 
 *  Then CRM       must NOT save the new prospect 
 *  And show a prompt to the user that ""You cannot save this prospect since there is a duplicate in the system"" 
 *  And show the account name, account number with sales skill (This will be customized based on the attributes matched during pre-save dup check) 
 

 

 *  No     Duplicate Found -- CRM will trigger MDM dup check  

 *  Given CRM      runs the duplicate check 

 *  When no       matches are returned 
 *  Then CRM       will run MDM dup check in the background (Covered in separate user story #890509  

 *  If        duplicates are found in MDM --> Save this prospect record in pending        approval status and add to Sales Ops Review  
 *  If duplicates are not        found in MDM --> Save this prospect in approved status and create        BCA, send IF10 request to MDM for this record  
 

 

 

 *  Duplicate     Detection Dialog will not be user facing and will run only in the     background 
 *  Consistency     Across QuickCreate & Full Form 

 *  Given a      prospect is created via QuickCreate 

 *  When       Save or Save & Close or Save & Create New is clicked 
 *  Then the       CRM pre-save duplicate check behavior using address and sales skill must       match the behavior on the standard Account form. 
 

 *  Given a      prospect is created via the full Account form 

 *  When       Save or Save & Close or Save & Create New is clicked 
 *  Then the       CRM pre-save duplicate check must behave identically.

 *  Address Verification Bypassed (e.g., Yes, No). 
 *  Duplicate-check user selection (e.g., No Duplicate Found, I Will Use Existing Account, Reject – Duplicate Found).

","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,CRM,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,4," *  Global Option Set Field Creation on the Account Table 

 *  Given CRM supports global option sets (Create Address Verified field on Account Table) 

 *  When the Address Verified option set is created 
 *  Then it must contain Yes / No, with no default value, and will be used only by automation. 
 

 *  Given CRM must record bypass behavior (Create Address Verification Bypassed field on Account Table) 

 *  When the Address Verification Bypassed option set is created 
 *  Then it must contain Yes / No, with no default value, and will be updated only by automation. 
 

 *  Given CRM must store duplicate check decisions (Create Duplicate Check User Selection field on Account Table) 

 *  When the Duplicate Check User Selection option set is created 
 *  Then it must contain: 

 *  No Duplicate Found 
 *  I Will Use Existing Account 
 *  Reject - Duplicate Found 
 *  And no default value must be set. 
 

 

 *  Given CRM must track completion of duplicate checks  (Create Is Duplicate Check Completed field on Account Table) 

 *  When the Is Duplicate Check Completed option set is created 
 *  Then it must contain Yes / No, with no default value, and will be maintained only by automated processes. 
 

 

 *  MDMID Field Creation  (Create Is MDMID field on Account Table) 

 *  Given CRM must store the technical identifier for MDM 

 *  When the MDM ID field is Created (ecl_mdmid) 
 *  Then it must be a text field (?100 chars) used only for storing the MDM GUID returned in IF10. 
 

 

 *  Form Layout & Visibility 

 *  Given the account form must display verification and duplicate check details 

 *  When modifying the form 
 *  Then a new section named MDM Validation must be created. 
 

 *  Given the MDM Validation section exists 

 *  When placing fields 
 *  Then all newly created fields must appear inside this section. 
 

 *  Given MDM validation Section is only applicable for 1C accounts 

 *  When users open an account 
 *  Then the entire MDM Validation section must be: 

 *  Visible for 1C accounts 
 *  Hidden for all non-1C accounts 
 

 

 

 *  Field Editability Rules (ALL FIELDS READ-ONLY) 

 *  Given the fields are system-controlled 

 *  When the MDM Validation fields appear on the form 
 *  Then all fields must be set to read-only for both prospects and customers. 
 

 *  Given address validation and duplicate checks are never manually entered

 *  Then users must not be able to type or modify manually: 

 *  Address Verified 
 *  Address Verification Bypassed 
 *  Duplicate Check User Selection 
 *  Is Duplicate Check Completed 
 *  MDM ID 
 

 

 

 *  Given the values are populated only via automation 

 *  When any of the duplicate check or address validation processes run 
 *  Then the system must update these read-only fields programmatically. 
 

 *  Backend Save Validation (Logic-Based, Not Form-Required) 

 *  Given address verification outcomes must exist before saving a new 1C Prospect 

 *  When the user clicks Save 
 *  Then backend logic must validate that either Address Verified OR Address Verification Bypassed contains a value, 
 *  And if both are blank, the save must be blocked with a clear error message. 
 

 *  Given non-1C prospects do not use address validation 

 *  When saving a non-1C account

 *  Prospect Quick Create form.  (Using PCF Control) 
 

 *  When the rep triggers address validation: 

 *  Allow user to click on ""Address Validation"" button only after all the mandate Address field details are added (Street 1, City, Country, State/Province, ZIP/Postal Code.) 
 *  Call the MDM address validation API (via Plugin)  
 *  Display standardized address suggestions in a modal/popup. - Same behavior as the main account form 
 *  Allow the user to: 

 *  Select a standardized address (update Street, City, State/Province, Postal Code, Country), or 
 *  Bypass address validation if invalid address is retrieved or API is unreachable 
 

 

 *  After successful validation: 

 *  Lock address fields for that operation (to avoid changes after validation). Lock address fields only after the prospect is saved successfully.  Upon saving the account record, the address fields must be locked. Any updates would be done by Sales Ops at a later stage.  
 *  Set “Address verification status” accordingly; if bypassed, set “bypassed” status. 

 *  Bypass option should only be populated if: 

 *  invalid address 
 *  API is unreachable 
 

 

 

 *  Ensure the prospect cannot be saved for 1C districts unless the address validation step has either passed or been explicitly bypassed. 
 *  Enforce Address Validation / Bypass as Pre-Condition Before Prospect Save for 1C Districts

 *  Given a user opens Prospect Quick Create form   
 *  When the form loads 

 *  Then an Address Validation control must be displayed under the address block in web. 
 *  And the control must appear only for 1C Prospect Accounts and Address should be validated to save the 1C prospect record 
 *  And must be hidden for non-1C accounts and address validation is not required to save the non-1C account records. 
 

 *  Given the control exists 

 *  When the user enters all mandate Address fields including Street, City, State/Province, Postal Code, and Country 
 *  Then the Address Validation control becomes enabled for the user to click and trigger the MDM address validation. 
 

 

 *  Triggering MDM Address Validation API - Remains same as main account form 

 *  Given the user clicks Validate Address 

 *  When CRM triggers validation 
 *  Then the system must call the MDM Address Validation API 
 *  And pass the required input fields (street, city, state, postal code, country). 
 

 *  Given the API responds successfully 

 *  When standardized address results are returned 
 *  Then a modal dialog must display all returned standardized address candidates 
 *  And the rep must be allowed to select one. 
 

 *  Given the rep selects a standardized address 

 *  When the user confirms 
 *  Then CRM must update all mapped address fields with standardized values 
 *  And set: 

 *  Address Verified = Yes  (Visible only after successfull validation, else hidden) 
 *  Address Verification Bypassed = No  (Should be Hidden ) 
 *  The above fields will be on the same QuickCreate form since PCF control has limitation of colour updates based OnClick or OnChange 
 *  The ADDRESS VALIDATION BUTTON SHOULD BE HIDDEN after validation 
 

 

 *  Given the rep edits the standardized address 

 *  When the user edits the address field (street, city, state, postal code, country) 
 *  The Address Validation button should be visible. 
 *  Then CRM must force the user to validate the address again and user cannot save the record 
 *  And set: 

 *  Address Verified = blank  (Should get hidden if its blank) 
 *  Address Verification Bypassed = blank (Should be hidden) 
 

 

 

 

 

 *  No Match Returned (Bypass Flow) 

 *  Given the API returns no standardized address candidates 

 *  When CRM displays a “No match found” message 
 *  Only Then the user must see a Bypass Address Validation option. 
 

 *  Given the rep clicks Bypass 

 *  When bypass is selected 
 *  Then CRM sets: 

 *  Address Verification Bypassed = Yes  
 *  Address Verified = No  
 *  And address fields on account remain unlocked 
 *  And the record becomes eligible for save. 
 

 

 

 *  Error Handling & Offline Behavior 

 *  Given the API times out, errors, or is unreachable 

 *  When the rep clicks Validate 
 *  Then CRM must show a message “Unable to validate address. Please try again or proceed using Bypass.” 
 *  Then the user must see a Bypass Address Validation option. 

 *  Given the rep clicks Bypass 

 *  When bypass is selected 
 *  Then CRM sets: 

 *  Address Verification Bypassed = Yes (Should be hidden) 
 *  Address Verified = No (Should be visible) 
 *  And allow the save operation. 
 

 

 *  The save button of the dialog modal popup should be disabled until the rep clicks on bypass checkbox. 
 

 

 *  Given the rep is using mobile online or offline mode   

 *  When they attempt to save a new prospect  
 *  Then CRM must automatically set:  
 *  Address Verified = No  
 *  And allow save.  
 *  This record should fall into Sales Ops review by default  
 

 

 *  Save Blocking Logic (1C Prospects Only) 

 *  Given the user attempts to Save a 1C Prospect 

 *  When both fields (Address Verified, Address Verification Bypassed) are blank 
 *  Then CRM must block the save 
 *  And display error: 
 *  “Address validation is required. Please validate or bypass to continue.” 
 

 *  Given the user is creating a non-1C prospect 

 *  When clicking save 
 *  Then CRM must allow save even if validation has not occurred. 
 

 *  Given the user tries to save the prospect without ""Address Validation"" on QuickCreate form 

 *  When clicking on ""Save and Close"" or ""Save and Create New"" without Address validation (To be checked against the value in the field Address Verified? ) 
 *  Then prompt the user to first finish address validation before saving with the message - ""Kindly complete Address Validation before proceeding"" 
 

 

 *  For mobile form, address validation button should not be visible irrespective of the app being used.  

 *  Button won't be visible due to compatibility issues irrespective of the app used on mobile 
 

 *  When the sync is triggered 

 *  Show error if pre-save has been triggered and there were duplicates - Dependency on #890508  
 

 

 

 *  UI Placement Requirements 

 *  Given the address section exists 

 *  When adding the control 
 *  Then the address validation button must be placed directly below the street/postal fields for QuickCreate  
 

 *  Given the MDM Validation section exists in Admin Section (created in previous story) 

 *  When the user opens the full form 
 *  Then the Address Verified and Address Verification Bypassed read-only fields must appear there.

 *  And pass the required input fields (street, city, state, postal code, country). 
 

 

 *  Given the API responds successfully 

 *  When standardized address results are returned 
 *  Then a modal dialog must display all returned standardized address candidates 
 *  And the rep must be allowed to select one. 
 

 *  Given the rep selects a standardized address 

 *  When the user confirms 
 *  Then CRM must update all mapped address fields with standardized values 
 *  And set: 

 *  Address Verified = Yes 
 *  Address Verification Bypassed = No 
 *  And lock all address fields from further edits.  
 *  The above fields will not be on the summary page, they will be on the Admin page of the account record.  
 

 

 *  Given the rep edits the standardized address 

 *  When the user edits the address field (street, city, state, postal code, country) 
 *  Then CRM must force the user to validate the address again and user cannot save the record 
 *  And set: 

 *  Address Verified = blank 
 *  Address Verification Bypassed = blank 
 

 

 

 

 

 *  No Match Returned (Bypass Flow) 

 *  Given the API returns no standardized address candidates 

 *  When CRM displays a “No match found” message 
 *  Then the user must see a Bypass Address Validation option. 
 

 *  Given the rep clicks Bypass 

 *  When bypass is selected 
 *  Then CRM sets: 

 *  Address Verification Bypassed = Yes 
 *  Address Verified = No 
 *  And address fields on account remain unlocked 
 *  And the record becomes eligible for save. 
 

 

 

 *  Error Handling & Mobile Behavior  

 *  Given the API times out, errors, or is unreachable 

 *  When the rep clicks Validate 
 *  Then CRM must show a message “Unable to validate address. Please try again or proceed using Bypass.” 
 *  Then the user must see a Bypass Address Validation option. 

 *  Given the rep clicks Bypass 

 *  When bypass is selected 
 *  Then CRM sets: 

 *  Address Verification Bypassed = Yes 
 *  Address Verified = No 
 *  And allow the save operation. 
 *  On Save or Save & Close, all the mandate Address fields must be locked out for any new updates 
 

 

 

 

 *  Given the rep is using mobile offline mode  

 *  When they attempt to save a new prospect  
 *  Then CRM must automatically set:  
 *  Address Verified = Leave it blank 
 *  Address Bypassed? = Leave it blank 
 *  And allow save.  
 

 

 *  Save Blocking Logic (1C Prospects Only) 

 *  Given the user attempts to Save a 1C Prospect 

 *  When both fields (Address Verified, Address Verification Bypassed) are blank 
 *  Then CRM must block the save 
 *  And display error: 
 *  “Address validation is required. Please validate or bypass to continue.” 
 

 *  Given the user is creating a non-1C prospect 

 *  When clicking save 
 *  Then CRM must allow save even if validation has not occurred. 
 

 

 *  UI Placement Requirements 

 *  Given the address section exists 

 *  When adding the control 
 *  Then the address validation button must be placed directly below the street/postal fields for QuickCreate and Standard form. 
 

 *  Given the MDM Validation section exists in Admin Section (created in previous story) 

 *  When the user opens the full form 
 *  Then the Address Verified and Address Verification Bypassed read-only fields must appear there. 
 

 

 

Note: When New fields are created to support this feature, please ensure you refer to this story to know the list of fields that needs to be created. #890505 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Global Option Set Field Creation on the Account Table 

 *  Given CRM supports global option sets (Create Address Verified field on Account Table) 

 *  When the Address Verified option set is created 
 *  Then it must contain Yes / No, with no default value, and will be used only by automation. 
 

 *  Given CRM must record bypass behavior (Create Address Verification Bypassed field on Account Table) 

 *  When the Address Verification Bypassed option set is created 
 *  Then it must contain Yes / No, with no default value, and will be updated only by automation.

4.Validate the address validation control should be hidden for non-1C accounts and address validation is not required to save the non-1C account records
 

 
Scenario 1B:
 
1.Validate the address validation control will becomes enabled for the user only when these all the fields should be entered - Street1, City, State/Province, Postal Code, and Country
 
2.Validate if there is one field data is missing then address validation control should not be enabled 
 
3.Validate on clicking the address validation control it will trigger the MDM address validation
 

 
Scenario 2:  MDM Validation block 
 
1.Validate MDM section should be present in the account form Admin tab
 
2.Validate the Address Verified and Address Verification Bypassed read-only fields must appear there.
 

 
Scenario 3: Save Blocking Logic (1C Prospects Only)
 
1.Login as FBU AM/DM/Ops admin user
 
2.Create a new prospect account and save the record
 
3.Validate when user attempts to save the 1C prospect account When both fields (Address Verified, Address Verification Bypassed) are blank, then CRM must block the save.
 
4.Validate the CRM should block the save and display the error
 

 
“Address validation is required. Please validate or bypass to continue.”
 

 
Scenario 4: Non 1C Prospect account (LS, NW, FB, TC)
 
1.Login as CRM AM/DM/Ops admin user
 
2.Create new non 1C prospect account and save3.Validate the CRM should allow to save the record without any address validation occurred 
 

 
Scenario 5: Triggering MDM Address Validation API
 
1.Validate on clicking the address validation control it will trigger the MDM address validation 
2.After the address is successfully validated, a pop-up window appears, presenting the sales representative with the standardized address options. 
 
3.The Sales Rep selects the correct address and clicks 'Save’ or can click ‘Cancel’ to retain the address manually added. If ‘Save’ is selected, the manual address is overwritten with the standardized address and address field is locked with a confirmation green ticket against Address Validation
4.Validate after selecting standardized address then CRM must update all mapped address fields with standardized values
 

 

 

 *  Address Verified = Yes 
 *  Address Verification Bypassed = No 
 

 

 
5.Validate all the address fields should be locked from further edits.
  
6.The above fields will not be on the summary page they will be on the admin page of the account record

",,,,,,
853535,Requirement,,,,,"Automate “Add Sales Skill” integration flow for existing prospects and customers, ensuring new sales skill records sync correctly across CRM, CLM, and MDM.",,,,"Business Objective:
Ensure that when an additional sales skill is required for an existing customer or prospect, the process is seamless and automated across CRM, CLM, and MDM. The system must prevent duplicate prospect creation, enforce use of the “Add Sales Skill” function, and synchronize updates via CLM APIs so that data integrity is maintained and users are guided to the correct workflow. 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  For Existing Customers 

 *  When a rep or Sales Ops user clicks Add Sales Skill on an existing customer record in CRM: 
 *  A new Sales Skill Account is created under the same BCA in CRM. 
 *  The request triggers an “Add Sales Skill” transaction via CLM API. 
 *  The new Sales Skill Account is flagged as Pending Review until CLM/EBS confirms activation. 
 *  Once approved, ERP number and ERP status are updated in CRM automatically. 
 

 *  For Prospects (Duplicate Handling) 

 *  If a rep attempts to create a new prospect and CLM flags it as an existing prospect/customer: 
 *  CRM must block the save action for the duplicate record. 
 *  The user is redirected to the correct existing record in CRM. 
 *  From that record, the user must use the Add Sales Skill button to initiate the new sales skill creation. 
 *  This ensures only valid, non-duplicate prospects exist in CRM. 
 

 *  Common Rules 

 *  No duplicate sales skill types (e.g., two Water or two Hygiene) should exist under one BCA. 
 *  Status handling: all new sales skill accounts default to Pending Review until CLM/EBS confirmation. 
 *  Users should always be guided to use Add Sales Skill rather than freeform prospect creation when expansion is needed. 
 

 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  CRM must: 

 *  Intercept save actions when duplicates are detected (via CLM API response). 
 *  Redirect users to the correct existing record and enforce “Add Sales Skill” usage. 
 *  Trigger outbound CLM API requests for new sales skill creation. 
 

 *  CLM API responses must update: 

 *  ERP account number, 
 *  ERP status, 
 *  and activation state for the new Sales Skill Account in CRM. 
 

 *  Error handling: if the API fails, the Sales Skill Account remains in Pending Review with escalation to Sales Ops. 
 *  Data model: ensure correct linkage between BCA, Sales Skill Accounts, and ERP identifiers. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Automated and controlled Add Sales Skill workflow in CRM for both existing customers and prospects. 
 *  Block-and-redirect behavior in CRM to prevent duplicate prospect saves. 
 *  New Sales Skill Accounts correctly created under BCAs with API-driven activation. 
 *  ERP identifiers and statuses automatically updated after CLM/EBS confirmation. 
 *  Documentation of the integration flow, error handling, and record ownership. 
 *  Tested scenarios covering: 
 *  Add Sales Skill for existing customer. 
 *  Add Sales Skill triggered when duplicate prospect detected. 
 *  Block-and-redirect logic validation. 
 *  Error/retry handling.

853582,Feature,,,,Integration: Integration of Billing Arrangements from EBS into CRM,,,,,"This feature introduces an automated integration to bring billing arrangements from EBS into CRM, replacing the current manual flat-file based process that relies on SAP BI outputs. With the transition of Nalco SAP accounts into EBS, all existing Nalco SAP billing arrangements tied to those accounts will be deactivated, and corresponding new billing arrangements will be created in EBS. The integration must enable CRM to receive, store, and surface these billing arrangements consistently, ensuring account teams have accurate visibility for service, order, and contract processes.

 
What This Feature Introduces 

 *  Deactivation of Legacy Billing Arrangements: Any billing arrangements tied to Nalco SAP accounts that migrate to EBS will be deactivated in CRM to prevent duplication. 
 *  Creation of New Billing Arrangements from EBS: New billing arrangements created in EBS for migrated accounts will flow into CRM through a new integration pipeline. 
 *  Snowflake-Based Integration Path: EBS billing arrangement data will be published to Snowflake. CRM will consume the data from Snowflake, ensuring a standardized and scalable integration approach. 
 *  CRM Billing Arrangement Table Enhancements: CRM billing arrangement records must be updated to reflect the new source (EBS) and maintain links to Sold-To accounts. 
 *  Automation: The new integration will fully replace the manual SAP BI flat-file process, ensuring timeliness, reliability, and auditability of billing arrangement updates.

836347,Requirement,,,,,23. Enable Billing Arrangement Retrieval for EBS via Snowflake Integration,,,,"Business Objective
 
To support billing operations for EBS-integrated customers within the ASA (Analytical Sampling App) and other dependent systems, billing arrangement data must be made available in CRM from EBS. Since the legacy method of receiving billing data from the NALCO SAP BI team is not applicable for EBS, a new integration must be built to retrieve billing arrangements from Snowflake and ingest them into CRM in a consistent and structured format. 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Today, billing arrangements are created in CRM via a flat file integration provided by the NALCO SAP BI team, which loads data into the Billing Arrangement custom table and associated Billing Arrangement Allocations table. 
 *  Each billing arrangement in CRM includes key data elements such as: 

 *  Billing Arrangement Number (SAP unique ID) 
 *  SHIP-TO Account (lookup) 
 *  Sold-To Account (lookup) 
 *  Start Date and End Date 
 *  Billing Arrangement Type (code) 
 *  Ownership and related Allocations 
 

 *  This setup supports NALCO SAP accounts only and will not work for EBS-integrated accounts, where the concept and availability of SHIP-TOs are different or absent. 
 *  For EBS customers, billing arrangement data will be exposed via Snowflake, and a new integration must be established to retrieve, transform, and load this data into CRM. 
 *  The business expects that billing arrangements for EBS customers are: 

 *  Continuously available in CRM 
 *  Accurately linked to the Sold-To account (and potentially to a new structure if SHIP-TO is not applicable) 
 *  Governed as read-only records, consistent with current SAP behavior 
 

 *  The new integration must not disrupt the existing NSAP setup and must allow both NSAP and EBS billing arrangements to coexist within the same CRM data model. 
 *  The data granularity and timing (e.g., daily, near real-time) must be defined in alignment with how ASA and other applications rely on this data during sample creation and billing processes. 
 *  The new Integration must make sure EBS billing arrangements are present in CRM, just like we do for SAP accounts today, so that ASA and other applications can work without disruption. The source will now be Snowflake instead of SAP BI. 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  A technical spike is required to assess: 

 *  What specific billing arrangement data is exposed by EBS in Snowflake 
 *  How the EBS data maps to the existing CRM schema for Billing Arrangements and Billing Arrangement Allocations 
 *  What transformations are needed between the Snowflake source and the CRM data model 
 *  Whether additional CRM fields or schema changes are needed for new EBS-specific fields 
 

 *  The integration will likely involve: 

 *  An Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline or equivalent mechanism to pull data from Snowflake 
 *  A data transformation layer (e.g., Azure Functions or Logic Apps) to align incoming records with CRM schema 
 *  A mechanism to create or update CRM Billing Arrangement and Allocation records on a daily or scheduled cadence 
 

 *  Error handling and logging must be implemented to support reconciliation and monitoring of data discrepancies or ingestion failures. 
 *  The system should dynamically identify whether a billing arrangement is coming from EBS vs. SAP, possibly using metadata or ERP indicators. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Completion of a technical spike to: 

 *  Analyze Snowflake billing arrangement structure from EBS 
 *  Define CRM data requirements and mapping logic 
 *  Confirm feasibility and transformation needs 
 

 *  Implementation of a net new ADF pipeline (or equivalent) to extract billing arrangement data from Snowflake 
 *  Logic to populate the CRM Billing Arrangement and Billing Arrangement Allocation tables, consistent with the existing model, but tailored to EBS accounts 
 *  Read-only setup in CRM for all EBS billing arrangement records, consistent with current governance 
 *  Regression testing to confirm ASA and other dependent apps continue functioning correctly with EBS billing arrangements 
 *  Coordination with both the EBS data team and ASA app owners to validate data availability, mappings, and timing 
 

 
Current Billing Arrangement Integration (NSAP ? CRM) 

 

 *  
Nightly flat is generated by the SAP BI team and stored in a shared location. This file is consumed by a CRM Integration job to create/update Billing Arrangements (BA's) in CRM. The SAP BI team generates the file via some automated process that pull all Active BA's in NSAP. 
 
 *  
Each Billing Arrangement is identified by the CRM Object ID field on the flat file (Billing Arrangement Number). 
 

 *  
Leading zeros from SAP are stripped when stored in CRM. 
 
 

 *  
Sold-To and Ship-To numbers are included and used to match Billing Arrangements to CRM accounts. 
 
 *  
ZZ Proc Type (Billing Arrangement Type): 
 

 *  
Indicates arrangement category (e.g., fixed, use risk, special pricing). 
 
 *  
CRM integration excludes any record with a type starting with “7” (e.g., ZSP1 – special pricing).  
 
 

 *  
Start Date and End Date: 
 

 *  
Included in the flat file and reformatted into CRM date fields. 
 
 

 *  
Ownership of BA: 
 

 *  
Derived from the ownership of the associated Ship-To account in CRM. 
 
 

 


 
Billing Arrangement Allocations (Related Table in CRM) 

 *  
In CRM Billing Arrangement Allocations are stored in a related table linked to each Billing Arrangement. 
 
 *  
Material column from the flat file indicates allocation type. 
 

 *  
CRM only pulls two types: Gen Service and Gen Analytical. 
 
 

 *  
Price_MAT column maps to the Allocated Funds field in CRM. 
 
 *  
Currency column indicates allocation currency (e.g., USD, CAD). 
 

 *  
Used for currency conversion and normalization to USD scale in reporting. 
 
 

 *  
A single Billing Arrangement can have multiple allocation rows. 
 
 *  
Allocations are primarily informational for business users. 
 

 *  
Absence of allocations does not break CRM processes. 
 
 *  
However, allocations are used by business teams for analysis and decision-making, so their inclusion remains important. 
 
 

 


 
CRM Entities and Fields Maintained Today 

 *  
Billing Arrangement Table (Header-level): 
 

 *  
Billing Arrangement Number (Object ID). 
 
 *  
Ship-To Account Number. 
 
 *  
Sold-To Account Number. 
 
 *  
Start Date. 
 
 *  
End Date. 
 
 *  
Billing Arrangement Type. 
 
 *  
Owner (derived from Ship-To). 
 
 

 *  
Billing Arrangement Allocation Table (Child/Related): 
 

 *  
Linked to Billing Arrangement by Object ID. 
 
 *  
Allocation Type (Gen Service / Gen Analytical). 
 
 *  
Allocated Funds (from Price_MAT). 
 
 

 


 
Snowflake/EBS Transition Requirements 

 *  
Current flat file integration is being reworked by Ayush to pull directly from NSAP Snowflake views. 
 

 *  
Once this process is finalized, the same approach can be extended to EBS: 
 
 *  
If EBS exposes a Snowflake view with the same fields and logic, the CRM integration can reuse Ayush’s process with minimal changes. 
 
 

 *  
Required expectations for the Snowflake feed from EBS: 
 

 *  
Include all Billing Arrangement header-level fields listed above. 
 
 *  
Include related Allocation-level fields (Allocation Type, Allocated Funds). 
 
 *  
Ensure exclusion logic for special pricing agreements (types with value = ZSP1) is retained. 
 
 *  
Maintain start/end dates and Sold-To/Ship-To fields for matching. 
 
 

 *  
Allocations may not exist for many Billing Arrangements. 
 

 *  
CRM and related processes continue to function without allocations. 
 
 *  
Still recommended to include allocations for completeness and business analysis needs. 
 
 

 


 
Things needed by the CRM team to start building this new EBS to CRM Billing Arrangement Integration: 

 *  
Provide an EBS Snowflake view with the same columns as the NSAP flat file. 
 
 *  
Confirm that allocation-level data will also be included in the view. 
 
 *  
Validate availability of key fields (Billing Arrangement Number, Ship-To, Sold-To, Start/End Dates, Type, Price). 
 
 *  
Once confirmed, we can extend Ayush’s Snowflake-based loader process to use the EBS view.

Background: 

 *  As part of the One Customer (1C) Billing Arrangement redesign: 

 *  Direct account lookups on the Billing Arrangement entity are being deprecated 
 *  Account relationships are now represented through a dedicated related table in CRM 
 *  Snowflake views must be updated to prevent exposing invalid or misleading data 
 

 *  Currently, the Snowflake view uvw_billingarrangements still exposes direct account reference columns that no longer represent the future-state CRM model. This creates a mismatch between CRM, integrations, and analytics. 
 *  This user story updates Snowflake to: 

 *  Remove deprecated account references from the main Billing Arrangement view 
 *  Introduce a new view to represent Billing Arrangement ? SHIP-TO relationships explicitly

System to correctly handle Billing Arrangements for customers who have multiple SoldTo accounts under one base customer account,
So that billing can be accurately created for the correct Ship-To account based on the associated sales skill (Water or Hygiene) without duplication or confusion. 

 *  Currently, Billing Arrangements in CRM require ShipTo information as mandatory. 
 *  For the 1FBU project, Billing Arrangements can be generated for Sold To/ShipTo, which can have both the sales skills (Water or Hygiene)

 *  How to identify the correct ShipTo account when creating a Billing Arrangement based on the sales skill. 
 *  Whether:

 *  A single Billing Arrangement should cover both Sold-To accounts or 
 *  Separate Billing Arrangements should be created for each SoldTo account (with the same Billing Arrangement number).

Business Requirements:
 

 *  Develop an automated integration (ADF/SSIS or equivalent) to extract billing arrangement headers from Snowflake. 
 *  Transform data per the mapping defined in the technical spike. #866571 
 *  Load data into the CRM Billing Arrangement entity while maintaining lookups to sold-to and ship-to accounts. 
 *  Apply exclusion logic for special pricing (e.g., ZSP1). 
 *  Preserve start and end dates from EBS; do not modify. 
 *  Ensure ownership aligns with the ship-to account owner. 
 *  Design integration to support incremental nightly loads and prevent duplication. 
 *  Implement comprehensive logging and error handling. 
 *  Ensure coexistence with NSAP billing arrangements without overwriting or conflict.

 *  When the integration job runs 
 *  Then CRM must receive and store all valid billing arrangement records with mapped fields populated accurately. 
 

 *  Given a billing arrangement record already exists in CRM 

 *  When the corresponding EBS record is updated in Snowflake 
 *  Then CRM must update the record without creating duplicates. 
 

 *  Given a billing arrangement record in Snowflake has a type (e.g., ZSP1) 

 *  When the integration job executes 
 *  Then the record must be excluded from CRM load. 
 

 *  Given an EBS billing arrangement references both sold-to and ship-to accounts 

 *  When the integration completes 
 *  Then those CRM lookups must resolve correctly and ownership must reflect the ship-to owner. 
 

 *  Given NSAP arrangements exist in CRM 

 *  When EBS data is loaded 
 *  Then both NSAP and EBS arrangements must coexist without impacting ASA functionality.

I want to deprecate direct account lookup fields on the Billing Arrangement table after R1
 
So that Billing Arrangement–to–account associations are represented only through the dedicated Billing Arrangement Account Relationship table, which is the valid One Customer (1C) data model.
 

 
Background: 
In the One Customer (1C) model:

 *  A Billing Arrangement may be associated with multiple account records 
 *  These associations are correctly modeled using a separate related table 
 *  During R1, legacy direct lookup fields were temporarily retained for backward compatibility 
 

 
Post R1, continuing to expose or populate these legacy fields results in: 

 *  Invalid data representation 
 *  User confusion (single-account impression vs multi-account reality) 
 *  Increased risk of incorrect downstream usage 
 

 
To align with the approved 1C architecture, direct account references on the Billing Arrangement table must be fully deprecated. 

 
Scope of Change 

 *  This story applies to the Billing Arrangement (Billing Enhancement) table and includes: 

 *  UI cleanup (forms and views) 
 *  Data cleanup 
 *  Prevention of future population 
 *  Enforcing the related table as the authoritative model

 *  Given a user opens any Billing Arrangement form 
 *  When the form loads 
 *  Then all deprecated direct account lookup fields are hidden 
 *  And users cannot view or edit these fields on any form variant 
 

 *  Scenario 2: Remove Deprecated Fields from Views 

 *  Given any Billing Arrangement view (system or custom) 
 *  When the view is accessed 
 *  Then deprecated account-related columns are removed 
 *  And views do not present Billing Arrangements as being linked to a single account 
 

 *  Scenario 3: Clear Existing Invalid Data 

 *  Given Billing Arrangement records created prior to deprecation 
 *  When the cleanup process runs 
 *  Then values in deprecated account lookup fields are cleared 
 *  And no Billing Arrangement record contains direct account references 
 

 *  Scenario 4: Delete the Sold To And Ship To Columns from the Billing Arrangement Table

898414,User Story,,,,,,Create Billing Arrangement–Account (SHIP-TO) Related Table for One-to-Many Associations (Introduces new related table without removing existing Sold-To / Ship-To lookups in BA table),,,"As a CRM platform
I want to introduce a new related table that associates a single Billing Arrangement to one or more SHIP-TO Accounts
 
So that Billing Arrangements can be linked to multiple account records without duplicating Billing Arrangement numbers, while preserving existing functionality during the R1 timeframe.
 

 
Background: 

 *  Today, the Billing Arrangement table in CRM stores direct lookups to: 

 *  Sold-To Account 
 *  Ship-To Account 
 

 *  With the One Customer (1C) model, a single customer may have multiple CRM account records (e.g., Water and Hygiene sales skills) tied to the same Base Customer Account (BCA). 
 *  This creates a challenge when: 

 *  A single Billing Arrangement number must apply to multiple SHIP-TO accounts 
 *  Duplicating Billing Arrangement records is not acceptable because Billing Arrangements represent master data 
 

 *  To support this model while minimizing risk for R1, a new related table will be introduced to enable a one-to-many relationship between Billing Arrangements and SHIP-TO Accounts. 
 *  Important R1 constraint: 

 *  Existing Sold-To and Ship-To lookups on the Billing Arrangement table must remain unchanged 
 *  No existing integrations or downstream processes should break 
 

 *  This design enables a phased transition: 

 *  R1: Introduce the new relationship model safely 
 *  Future releases: Migrate consuming logic to the related table and retire legacy lookups

","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,Review,\FBU 1C,"LaPlante, Chris",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,1,"  Scenario: Distinguish between SAP and EBS records

    Then it should include a source indicator (e.g., ERP type) 
    And the system should not overwrite existing SAP records

898435,User Story,,,,,,ADF Pipeline: Enhance EBS Billing Arrangement Inbound Integration to Populate SHIP-TO Associations in Related Table (Continue Water-only population on BA table; add SHIP-TO records for Water and Hygiene into related table),,,"As an inbound integration (ADF pipeline)
I want to populate Billing Arrangement data in CRM using a consistent, sales-skill–aware logic
 
So that Billing Arrangements are correctly associated to Water and Hygiene SHIP-TO accounts without duplicating Billing Arrangement numbers and while preserving existing R1 behavior.
 

 
Background: 

 *  Billing Arrangements (BA) are received from EBS and loaded into CRM via ADF pipelines. 
 *  Today, the Billing Arrangement table supports only one Sold-To and one Ship-To lookup, which creates a limitation under the One Customer (1C) model: 

 *  A single BA number can apply to both Water and Hygiene sales skills 
 *  CRM stores Water and Hygiene as separate account records, even when they belong to the same Base Customer Account (BCA) 
 *  Duplicating BA records is not acceptable, as BA is master data 
 

 *  For R1, Water processes (Field Service, ASA, recurring services) are the primary consumers of Billing Arrangements. Therefore: 

 *  The Billing Arrangement table must continue to store one primary Sold-To / Ship-To 
 *  A new related table must capture all SHIP-TO associations (Water and Hygiene) for future use 
 

 *  This user story defines how the ADF inbound integration must populate: 

 *  The Billing Arrangement table (primary association) 
 *  The Billing Arrangement – Account related table (complete association set) 
 

 *  High-Level Integration Behavior: 

 *  The Billing Arrangement table will store one primary association, prioritized for Water 
 *  The related table will store all applicable SHIP-TO associations (Water and/or Hygiene) 
 *  This ensures no BA duplication while supporting future-state use cases

 *  Scenario 1: Only Hygiene Sales Skill Exists 

 *  Given a Billing Arrangement is received from EBS 
 *  And only a Hygiene sales skill account exists for the BA 
 *  When the ADF pipeline processes the record 
 *  Then the Billing Arrangement table is populated with the Hygiene Sold-To and Ship-To 
 *  And the related table contains a single SHIP-TO association for the Hygiene account 
 

 *  Scenario 2: Only Water Sales Skill Exists 

 *  Given a Billing Arrangement is received from ABS 
 *  And only a Water sales skill account exists for the BA 
 *  When the ADF pipeline processes the record 
 *  Then the Billing Arrangement table is populated with the Water Sold-To and Ship-To 
 *  And the related table contains a single SHIP-TO association for the Water account 
 

 *  Scenario 3: Water and Hygiene Share the Same Billing Arrangement 

 *  Given a Billing Arrangement is received from EBS 
 *  And both Water and Hygiene sales skill accounts exist 
 *  And they share the same Billing Arrangement number 
 *  When the ADF pipeline processes the record 
 *  Then the Billing Arrangement table is populated only with the Water Sold-To and Ship-To 
 *  And the related table contains two SHIP-TO associations: 

 *  One for the Water account 
 *  One for the Hygiene account 
 

 

 *  Scenario 4: No Duplicate Billing Arrangement Records 

 *  Given a Billing Arrangement number already exists in CRM 
 *  When additional sales skill associations are identified 
 *  Then no new Billing Arrangement record is created

834314,Feature,,,,Integration: CRM to Ecolab 3D and Ecolab 3D to CRM Integration Regression & Sanity Testing for One Customer Structure,,,,,"This feature captures the end-to-end regression and sanity testing scope for existing bi-directional integrations between Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM, CDM, and Ecolab 3D, in preparation for the One Customer structure go-live.
 

 
While no new functionality or core changes are expected across the CRM ? Ecolab 3D integration stack, the introduction of Base Customer Account (BCA), SOLD-TO realignment, business line convergence, and sales skill tagging necessitates thorough regression and sanity testing to ensure continued stability and accuracy of these flows.
 

 
The integration covers four key synchronization areas, each with associated testing scope:
 

 
Integration Flows & Testing Scope: 

 *  Asset Tree Integration (Ecolab 3D ? CRM) 

 *  Sync Type: Event-driven via Azure Event Hub and Service Bus 
 *  Mechanism: CDM syncs site and asset keys ? Ecolab 3D emits JSON ? CRM receives via Azure Function and stores in Dataverse. 
 *  Testing Scope: 

 *  Regression Testing: 

 *  Site Merge Scenarios: Ensure asset linkage, service plans, and visits remain intact. 
 *  Site Split Scenarios: Validate fallback logic for asset reassignment and CRM updates. 
 

 *   Sanity Testing: 

 *  New site creation: Confirm creation on-the-fly in CRM via CDM API if not pre-existing. 
 *  Field updates (e.g., BCA, sales skill) are preserved in sync logic.

 
 

 

 

 *  Action Logs / Recommendations (CRM to Ecolab 3D and E3D to CRM) 

 *  Sync Type: Bi-directional via API + Service Bus 
 *  Terminology: “Recommendation” in CRM = “Action Log” in Ecolab 3D 
 *  Testing Scope: 

 *  Regression Testing: 

 *  Validate OIP ID-based sync continues to match correct asset/site post merge/split. 
 *  Confirm filtering and sales skill tagging attributes flow correctly. 
 

 

 

 *  Sanity Testing: 

 *  Test creation and update in both systems sync correctly. 
 *  Validate attachment storage (Azure Blob) and metadata mapping. 

 
 

 

 

 *  Service Summary Dashboard (SSD) 

 *  Components: 

 *  Widget in Ecolab 3D (pulls service completion data from CRM) 
 *  PDF Report pushed to customer post-service 
 

 *  Testing Scope: 

 *  Sanity Testing: 

 *  Ensure widget renders correctly for merged site/account structures. 
 *  Confirm SSD PDFs trigger and send as expected. 
 

 

 *  No change expected in logic; test only for structural impacts. 

 
 

 *  Additional Scenarios to Cover in Testing: 

 *  Edge cases with homeless sites in Ecolab 3D awaiting mapping. 
 *  Filtering by business line (Water, F&B Hygiene, Textile) post-convergence. 
 *  Impact of changes in CRM field structures (e.g., new BCA, sales skill) on existing integration libraries (library shared across CDM and E3D). 
 *  Action log filtering by responsible party, timestamps, and problem status. 

 
 

 *  Testing Notes & Responsibilities: 

 *  No change required in core integration code unless business flags new requirements. 
 *  Shared libraries (e.g., fallback fetch via CDM API) may require minor updates for any new field inclusions like sales skill or BCA. 
 *  Testing to be isolated to functional flows, not underlying infrastructure. 
 *  Coordination needed with Ecolab 3D team, CRM Dev team, and CDM integration owners to validate test results. 
 *  Include non-prod (QA/Test) environment validation, considering partial sync coverage due to legacy data. 

 
 

 *  Outcome: 

 *  Upon successful completion of regression and sanity testing, the CRM to Ecolab 3D and E3D to CRM integrations will be certified as ready for One Customer Go-Live, with confidence in structural alignment, action/asset traceability, and business line filtering logic.

834684,Requirement,,,,,41. Regression Test All E3 to CRM and CRM to E3D integrations Post One Customer Structure Alignment,,,,"Business Context:
 
Ecolab 3D and Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM are integrated to support service delivery, asset visibility, and site-level analytics. The One Customer initiative introduces key structural changes like Base Customer Account (BCA), Sold-To replacing Ship-To, and sales skill–based segmentation. These changes may impact how data flows between CRM and Ecolab 3D. While no direct changes to the integration are currently planned, thorough regression and sanity testing are needed to confirm continued functionality across all core integration flows, especially in merged or split site scenarios.
 

 
Business Requirements:
 

 *  Validate that asset records remain accurately synced between CRM and Ecolab 3D after site merges or splits. 
 *  Confirm that recommendations (CRM) and action logs (Ecolab 3D) remain bidirectionally synced and correctly attributed to sites and assets. 
 *  Ensure that the Service Summary Dashboard (SSD) continues to function correctly, including PDF generation and data display. 
 *  Verify that filtering by sales skill, business line (Water, F&B Hygiene), and Ecolab Water for Climate flags works correctly after site/account changes. 
 *  Confirm fallback logic triggers appropriately when CRM is missing site or account records referenced by Ecolab 3D. 
 

 
Detailed Regression and Sanity Testing Scope: 

 *  Asset Tree Sync (Ecolab 3D to CRM) 

 *  Regression Testing: 

 *  Validate asset sync from merged CDM sites to unified CRM site records. 
 *  Confirm behavior in split site cases where asset relationships may need reassignment or manual review. 
 

 *  Sanity Testing: 

 *  Validate that newly created CDM sites sync properly to CRM and Ecolab 3D. 
 *  Test near real-time asset updates from Ecolab 3D to CRM.

 
 

 

 *  Recommendations and Action Logs (Bi-directional) 

 *  Regression Testing: 

 *  Validate recommendations and action logs are preserved across merged or realigned sites and assets. 
 *  Check proper division and sales skill tagging post-merge. 
 

 

 *  Sanity Testing: 

 *  Confirm new CRM recommendations sync to Ecolab 3D and vice versa. 
 *  Validate updates and attachment references remain functional. 

 
 

 

 *  Service Summary Dashboard (SSD) 

 *  Sanity Testing: 

 *  Confirm SSD widget shows latest service data post-site/account changes. 
 *  Validate customer-facing PDFs are still generated correctly. 
 *  Check that global business fields and division filters are unaffected. 
 

 

 

 

 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  A complete regression testing checklist including all key integration scenarios. 
 *  Executed test cases for site merges, site splits, asset re-linking, and action log flows. 
 *  Sanity test results confirming that key sync points behave correctly in edge cases. 
 *  Documentation of any integration gaps, sync issues, or defect findings. 
 *  Final stakeholder sign-off confirming integrations are stable and regression tested for One Customer go-live.

849501,Feature,,,,Data Conversion: CRM & SharePoint: Documents (File Attachments),,,,,"Storage by Document Storage ToolType 
•Dataverse(CRM):Hygiene uses custom Attachment table to store documents. (Dataverse File Typefield is used to store the documents) 
•SharePoint:Water Uses Native CRM SharePoint integration to store documents 
Validated Findings: 
•NoHarmonization:  
•R1/R2scope does not include unifying document storage strategies.  
•HarmonizingWater & Hygiene use of SharePoint/Dataverse for document management is notdesired and not required for R2. 
•Security Considerations:Attachment table in CRM offers native record level security; SharePoint doesnot. Harmonization would require significant effort and change management.Security profile is not significant enough to warrant adding documentharmonization to known future scope. 
•Thereare no requirements for BCA To have a consolidated view of documents. 
•Thereare no R2 requirements to enable Hygiene/Dataverse documents to merge as partof OneCustomer Account record merging efforts. This because it is handled viaout of the box  record merging capabilitywhen the accounts are merged. 
•Water/SharePointdocuments will not automatically merge when these Accounts are merged. Sothere would Data Migration work involved to move documents from the Inactivewater account’s SharePoint Site to the surviving water account’s SharePointSite, when multiple versions of a water account are merged before linking thesurviving water account to the BCA in CRM. 
•Enterpriselevel document management tool that will be introduced by Ecolab in the futureis not in scope for R1/R2. That project may complete mid-2026. 
• 
Expected Changes 
•Nochanges to current document workflows for hygiene or water in R1/R2. 
•ManualSharePoint migration is required for water account merges. 
Hygieneonboarding to Ecolab3D is phased: initial enablement followed by full assetsetup by February 2026.

 *  Identify SharePoint folders tied to accounts being merged. 
 *  Migrate all documents from deactivated account folders to the surviving account’s folder. 
 *  Ensure document visibility in Ecolab 3D remains intact post-merge.

865518,User Story,,,,,,DC: 1C Go-Live – Migrate SharePoint Documents During Water Account Merges (Canada & USA),,,"As a data conversion team member,
I need to identify and migrate SharePoint documents from inactive (merged) Water accounts to the surviving Water account,
 
so that all customer documents remain accessible post-merge, since Dataverse account merge does not automatically move SharePoint libraries.
 

 
This activity must support both Canada and USA 1C Go-Live cutovers and apply to all merge scenarios involving multiple Water accounts. 
 

 
Background/Context: 

 *  As part of the 1C account merge process, multiple Water accounts may be merged into a single surviving Water account 
 *  Dataverse out-of-the-box account merge does NOT merge SharePoint document libraries 
 *  Without intervention: 

 *  Documents remain attached to inactive Water accounts 
 *  Users lose visibility to historical documents post-merge 
 

 *  This impacts both: 

 *  Canada 1C Go-Live 
 *  USA 1C Go-Live 
 

 

Source of Truth for Merge Identification:
 
 

 *  Canada: [1CGoLiveExcelData] 
 *  USA: [1CGoLiveExcelData_USA] 
 *  These tables define: 

 *  Survivor Water account 
 *  Inactive (merged) Water accounts 
 *  Applicable merge scenarios 
 

 

In-Scope Merge Scenarios:
 
 

 *  This story applies to Water-only merge scenarios, including (but not limited to):(Any scenario where multiple Water accounts collapse into one surviving Water account) 
 *  Sold_To_5 
 *  Sold_To_6 
 *  Sold_To_9 
 


 
 
In Scope: 

 *  Identify inactive Water accounts being merged 
 *  Identify surviving Water account 
 *  Detect SharePoint documents attached to inactive accounts 
 *  Move documents to the survivor account’s SharePoint library 
 *  Preserve: 

 *  Document content 
 *  File names 
 *  Versions 
 *  Metadata (where supported)

 *  Given Go-Live data is available 
 *  When the conversion process runs 
 *  Then the system identifies all scenarios where: 

 *  Multiple Water accounts exist 
 *  One Water account is marked as the survivor 
 *  One or more Water accounts are marked inactive post-merge 
 

 

 *  Source Table Selection 

 *  Given the cutover country is known 
 *  When merge identification begins 
 *  Then: 

 *  Canada merges use [1CGoLiveExcelData] 
 *  USA merges use [1CGoLiveExcelData_USA] 
 

 

 *  Detect SharePoint Documents on Inactive Accounts 

 *  Given an inactive Water account is identified 
 *  When its SharePoint document location is evaluated 
 *  Then all documents associated with that account’s SharePoint library are identified for migration 
 

 *  Move Documents to Survivor Account 

 *  Given documents exist on an inactive Water account 
 *  When document migration is executed 
 *  Then documents are moved to the surviving Water account’s SharePoint library 
 

 *  Preserve Document Integrity 

 *  Given documents are migrated 
 *  When the move completes 
 *  Then: 

 *  File content is preserved 
 *  File name is unchanged 
 *  Folder structure is preserved (where applicable) 
 *  Version history is retained (subject to SharePoint constraints) 
 

 

 *  Avoid Duplicate Document Creation 

 *  Given documents are moved 
 *  When a document with the same name already exists on the survivor account 
 *  Then the process: 

 *  Prevents silent duplication 
 *  Follows defined conflict handling rules (e.g., append suffix or log exception) 
 

 

 *  Logging and Traceability 

 *  Given document migration occurs 
 *  When the process completes 
 *  Then a log is produced containing: 

 *  Source account ID 
 *  Survivor account ID 
 *  Document count moved 
 *  Any failures or skipped records

I want to clone and update existing Canada 1C SSIS packages to support USA 1C Go-Live data using a separate source table,
 
so that both Canada and USA 1C data are available in lower environments for UAT without impacting or reworking the existing Canada conversion logic.
 

 
Background / Context: 

 *  The Canada 1C Go-Live data conversion is already implemented using SSIS packages that source data from: 
 *  [1CGoLiveExcelData] 
 *  For USA 1C, a new table has been created and populated with identical schema: 
 *  [1CGoLiveExcelData_USA] 
 *  To support parallel UAT for Canada and USA (targeting mid-January 2026), the data conversion logic must: 

 *  Reuse the existing Canada SSIS logic 
 *  Avoid modifying or destabilizing Canada packages 
 *  Introduce USA-specific cloned packages that point exclusively to USA Go-Live data 
 

 

Scope: 
 

 *  Cloning existing SSIS packages that currently reference [1CGoLiveExcelData] 
 *  Updating cloned packages to reference [1CGoLiveExcelData_USA] 
 *  Supporting all Sold-To and Ship-To scenarios currently handled for Canada 
 *  Updating validation and post-load scripts to support USA data 
 

Naming Convention: 

 *  Canada packages: No change
 
 *  USA packages: USA_<ExistingPackageName> 

 *  Example:  

 *  USA_Load_1C_SoldTo_Accounts 
 *  USA_Load_1C_ShipTo_Sites

 *  Given pre-load, post-load, and validation SQL scripts used by Canada packages 
 *  When USA conversion is implemented 
 *  Then equivalent USA scripts are created that reference [1CGoLiveExcelData_USA] 
 

 *  Scenario Coverage 

 *  Given the existing Canada conversion supports: 

 *  Sold-To scenarios (e.g., Sold-To-1 through Sold-To-9) 
 *  Ship-To scenarios 
 

 *  When USA packages are executed 
 *  Then all the same scenarios are supported using USA Go-Live data 
 

 *  Parallel Execution 

 *  Given both Canada and USA packages exist

861021,User Story,,,,,,DC: Recreate Water SOWs to Surviving Hygiene H5 Accounts.,,,"As a Data Conversion Analyst,
 
I need to re-parent all active Scope of Work (SOW) records from Water H5 accounts to the surviving Hygiene H5 account during the 1C consolidation,
 
So that there is a single surviving H5 account holding both Water and Hygiene SOWs, ensuring continuity and alignment with the One Customer model.
 

 
Background & Rationale:
 

 *  In the One Customer (1C) design, Water H5 accounts are being merged into Hygiene H5 accounts. 
 *  Today, SOWs are tied directly to H5 accounts. Without re-parenting, Water SOWs would remain orphaned on inactive Water H5 accounts. 
 *  Business requires that all active Water SOWs be preserved and made visible under the surviving Hygiene H5 account. 
 *  Re-parenting ensures data continuity, user visibility, and downstream alignment with Sales Skill–based filtering. 
 *  Non-1C accounts remain unchanged. 
 


 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Identify all Water H5 accounts marked for consolidation into Hygiene H5 accounts. 
 *  Re-parent all active SOWs from Water H5 accounts to the mapped surviving Hygiene H5 account. 
 *  Ensure inactive/expired SOWs remain untouched. 
 *  Preserve all SOW attributes during migration (Name, Start Date, End Date, Status, Owner, Sales Skill, Commitments). 
 *  Update relationships so that re-parented SOWs appear correctly in the SOW tab of the surviving Hygiene H5. 
 *  Generate audit logs of re-parenting (source H5, target H5, SOW IDs moved, timestamp). 
 *  Produce an exception report for any failures or unmapped records. 
 *  Apply changes only for 1C districts; no impact to non-1C H5s. 
 

 

 
 

","Nguyen, Chau",Pending PO Review,Data Migration; R2; TestingTobeSplit,\FBU 1C\Data,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 26.17.05,2,Moved out of state In QA,Business,5,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 
 
 
 

 *  Scenario 1 – Active Water SOWs on 1C H5 merge 

 *  Given a Water H5 account is merged into a Hygiene H5 account as part of 1C consolidation, 
 *  When the data conversion process runs, 
 *  Then all active SOWs from the Water H5 must be re-created to the surviving Hygiene H5 account. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – Expired/Inactive Water SOWs 

 *  Given a Water H5 account has inactive or expired SOWs, 
 *  When the data conversion process runs, 
 *  Then those inactive records remain unchanged and do not require re-parenting. 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Data continuity validation 

 *  Given re-parenting has been executed, 
 *  When I view the surviving Hygiene H5 account, 
 *  Then all previously active Water SOWs should appear in the SOW grid of the Hygiene H5, with their original details preserved (name, start/end date, status, owner, sales skill). 
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Non-1C accounts 

 *  Given a Water H5 account is not in a 1C district, 
 *  When the data conversion runs, 
 *  Then no changes occur and the Water H5 retains its existing SOWs. 
 

 *  Scenario 5 – Exception reporting 

 *  Given a re-parenting job is run, 
 *  When a Water SOW cannot be re-parented (e.g., missing Hygiene H5 mapping), 
 *  Then the process must log the exception with record details for reconciliation.

Source-  SQL  Target - CRM 
  
Scenario1: Re-parent active Water SOWs to the surviving Hygiene H5 account during the1C merge. 
Steps: 

 
 *  Precondition: Water H5 account merged     with Hygiene H5 and has active SOWs (i.e., status = Active, valid dates). 
 
 *  After the data conversion     package executed then validates that all active SOWs from the Water H5 must be re-created to the surviving Hygiene H5 account. 
 

  
Scenario2: Ensure expired / inactive  Water SOWs are not re-parented. 
Steps: 

 
 *  Precondition:     Water H5 account merged with Hygiene H5 and has inactive /expired SOWs  
 
 *  After     the data conversion package executed, they validate that for all Inactive/Expired     Water SOWs,records remain unchanged and do not require re-parenting. 
 

  
Scenario 3: Data continuity validation 
Steps: 

 *  Precondition: re-parenting has been executed 
 *  When user view Surviving Hygiene H5 account, then all previously active Water SOWs should appear in the SOW grid of the Hygiene H5, with their original details preserved (name, start/end date, status, owner, sales skill). 
 

  
 
 Scenario 4:Exclude Water H5 accounts not part of the 1C district merge from re-parentinglogic. 
Steps: 
  

 
 *  Precondition: Water H5 account belongs     to Non 1C district 
 
 *  After the data conversion     package executed, no changes occur and the Water H5 retains its existing SOWs. 
 

  
Scenario 5: Ensure Draft Water SOWs are not re-parented. 
Steps: 

 *  Precondition: Water H5 account merged with Hygiene H5 and has  Draft SOWs 
 *  After the data conversion package executed, they validate that for all Draft  Water SOWs, their parent account remains unchanged, and no updates should be made under SOW grid on surviving account 
 

 
 
 Scenario 6: Exception Reporting for Re-parenting Failures 
Steps: 
Precondition– Reparenting job can’t be completed due to timeout or other conflicts or missing Hygiene H5 mapping 
2. Anexception must be logged with record details for further investigation.

 ","Yellapantula, Siva",Pending PO Review,Data Migration,\FBU 1C\Data,"Bargabus, Carol",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.17.02,2,Moved out of state In Development,Business,10,"Business Acceptance Criteria:  

 *  Load U.S. dataset for analysis 

 *  Given the business has shared a U.S. Sold-To/Ship-To file, 
 *  When analysis begins, 
 *  Then the file must be loaded into a temporary SQL table for classified scenario analysis. 
 

 *  Classify all Sold-To scenarios (Scenario 1–9) 

 *  Given the data is available in the staging table, 
 *  When scenario logic is applied, 
 *  Then each record must be categorized into one of the following: 

 *  Sold-To Scenario 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9— 
 *  and counts must be produced per scenario. 
 

 

 *  Identify Ship-Tos that will convert to Sold-Tos 

 *  Given scenario rules include Ship-To ? Sold-To transformations, 
 *  When conditions are evaluated, 
 *  Then the analysis must produce: 

 *  List of Ship-To numbers converting to Sold-To 
 *  Count of such records 
 *  Flag per record indicating the scenario causing the conversion 
 

 

 *  Cross-validate account existence against CRM Production 

 *  Given CRM production contains active 1C districts and active accounts, 
 *  When the dataset is compared, 
 *  Then the output must identify: 

 *  Accounts present in CRM but missing in the business file 
 *  Accounts present in the business file but inactive in CRM 
 *  Accounts repeated or incorrectly duplicated 
 *  Any district-mismatch issues 
 

 

 *  Validate H5 (Org Account) alignment for Water accounts 
 *  Given each Water Sold-To is tied to an Org Account 
 *  When child accounts related to that Org Account are retrieved , 
 *  Then the analysis must identify: 

 *  What child Accounts linked to Water Org Account are missing from business go live data for USA Accounts 
 *  How many org accounts have all child accounts part of the 1C go live data 
 *  Accounts mapped to legacy Water/Hygiene org accounts that do not exist in the 1C file 
 

 *  Identify “surviving” vs “non-surviving” records 

 *  Given the 1C business file includes survivor markers, 
 *  When those flags are read, 
 *  Then the analysis must: 

 *  Produce a list of expected surviving accounts 
 *  Confirm whether surviving accounts actually exist in CRM 
 *  Identify records incorrectly flagged or missing a survivor indicator 
 

 

 *  Analyze corporate account alignment (Water vs Hygiene) 

 *  Given corporate IDs differ between Water and Hygiene in many cases, 
 *  When comparison is run per BCA, 
 *  Then the analysis must identify: 

 *  Mismatches where Water ? Hygiene 
 *  Missing corporate IDs on either side 
 *  Cases where Hygiene corporate is empty but Water corporate has value 
 *  Cases where Water is empty but Hygiene has value 
 

 

 *  Provide detailed counts and summaries 

 *  Given analysis has been completed, 
 *  When preparing outputs, 
 *  Then the story must produce:

 *  Count of mismatches 
 *  Count of missing or unexpected records 
 *  Corporate alignment summary 
 *  H5 alignment summary 
 *  Final exceptions list 
 

 

 *  Provide detailed discrepancy list to business 
 *  Given all discrepancies are identified, 
 *  When results are compiled, 
 *  Then a structured output must be delivered containing: 

 *  Missing accounts 
 *  Inactive vs active mismatches 
 *  Corporate ID misalignment 
 *  Orphan child accounts

849661,User Story,,,,,,DC: Data Migration of Service Templates to Surviving H5 Organization Accounts After 1C Conversion,,,"As a CRM Data Migration Engineer,
I need to migrate all Water service templates (and their dependent child records) from legacy Water organization accounts into the surviving merged H5 Organization Account,
 
so that Water + Hygiene share a single combined service template structure under the unified 1C account model, without losing any legacy configurations.
 

 
Context and Background: 
In the current (pre-1C) CRM structure, Water and Hygiene maintain separate Organization Accounts and separate Service Templates for the same customer.
After 1C conversion:
 

 *  Both Water and Hygiene Sales Skill Accounts will be merged and linked to one unified H5 Organization Account. 
 *  Under the 1C model, each H5 org account must have one combined service template per asset type (not separate Water/Hygiene templates). 
 

 
Therefore, as part of data migration: 

 *  We must identify all legacy Water org accounts participating in the 1C merge. 
 *  For each Water org account, retrieve all active service template records and copy them under the corresponding surviving H5 org account. 
 *  Ensure no duplicate service templates are created if the Hygiene org account already owns a template for the same asset type. 
 *  Migrate the entire hierarchy of template-related records: 

 *  Asset Type Template 
 *  Asset Type Service Template 
 *  Asset Type Service Template Activity 
 *  Asset Type Service Template Sub-Task 
 

 *  Mark each migrated template with the correct SalesSkillDescription value (Hygiene / Water / Hygiene and Water ). 
 *  All moves are copy-and-relink, not delete-and-replace. 
 *  All joins, child table logic, and conditions must follow CRM table listed in the attached SQL Queries 
 

 
 
 
","Nguyen, Chau",Pending PO Review,Data Migration; TestingTobeSplit,\FBU 1C\Data,"Bargabus, Carol",\One Dynamics\Sprint 26.17.05,2,Moved out of state In QA,Business,14,"Business Acceptance Criteria: 

 *  Identify all Water org accounts requiring migration 

 *  Given a list of legacy Water Sold-To accounts that participate in 1C merging, 
 *  When the migration begins, 
 *  Then the system must retrieve: 

 *  The Water Org Account ID linked to each Sold-To. 
 *  The corresponding surviving H5 Org Account ID from the 1C Go Live table ([1CGoLiveExcelData]). 
 

 

 *  Retrieve all active service template records from Water org accounts 

 *  Given a Water org account that is being merged, 
 *  When querying the template tables, 
 *  Then the migration must fetch only active records from: 

 *  ECL_AssetTypeTemplate 
 *  ECL_AssetTypeServiceTemplate 
 *  ECL_AssetTypeServiceTemplateActivity 
 *  ECL_AssetTypeServiceTemplateSubTask 
 

 *  Using the proper joins between: Attached SQL Query has all the joins properly identified 
 *  AssetTypeTemplate ? ServiceTemplate ? Activity ? SubTask 
 

 *  Prevent creation of duplicate service templates under H5 

 *  Given an asset type already exists in the Hygiene/H5 service templates, 
 *  When Water templates are being migrated, 
 *  Then: 
 *  Do NOT create a new Asset Type Template for the same asset type under the H5 org account. 
 *  Only copy related child records (ServiceTemplate, Activity, SubTask) and re-link them to the existing template. 
 

 *  Create new Asset Type Template only when asset type does not already exist 

 *  Given the Water org account has a template for an asset type that does not exist under H5, 
 *  When migrating, 
 *  Then: 
 *  Create a new Asset Type Template under the H5 org account. 
 *  Set the SalesSkillDescription value appropriately: 
 *  “Water ” 
 *  “Hygiene ” 
 *  “Water and Hygiene” (if combined) 
 

 *  Migrate the hierarchy of related template records 

 *  Given Water template records are being copied, 
 *  When creating corresponding ServiceTemplate, Activity, and SubTask records under H5, 
 *  Then: 
 *  All child objects must be created with new GUIDs. 
 *  All parent-child links must reference the H5 Asset Type Template version. 
 *  Only active original records should be migrated. 
 

 *  Re-link all migrated records to H5 org account 

 *  Given the new or existing H5 Asset Type Template record, 
 *  When creating the migrated versions, 
 *  Then: 
 *  All records must reference the H5 Organization Account ID. 
 *  No migrated record should reference the legacy Water org account. 
 

 *  No changes should be made to original Water templates 

 *  Given Water org accounts will be made inactive after the merge, 
 *  When the migration is executed, 
 *  Then: 
 *  Original Water templates remain untouched. 
 *  Only the new copies under H5 are used going forward. 
 

 *  Migration audit output must be produced 

 *  Given migration execution is complete, 
 *  When generating the summary, 
 *  Then the team must produce: 
 *  Count of templates found 
 *  Count of templates migrated 
 *  Count of asset types skipped due to duplicates 
 *  Count of activities & subtasks migrated 
 *  Any errors or mismatches

Context: 
 

 *  The TSR process is used to initiate and manage technical service requests across divisions (Nalco Water, Food & Beverage, Life Sciences). 
 *  It supports service delivery, resource assignment, and approval workflows. 
 *  A separate active project is focused on harmonizing the TSR process across divisions to ensure consistency and enable CRM-driven automation and reporting. 
 *  This harmonization effort is not in R1 or R2 scope. No ETA on project timeline. 
 

 
 
Groups:
 
 

 *   Hygiene, Water, & Life Sciences 
 

 
 
Personas: 
 
 

 *  Product Owner: Kathleen Guekens 
 *  Sales Representatives initiate TSRs. 
 *  Technical Resource Managers (TRMs) approve and assign Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). 
 *  SMEs execute the service visits. 
 *  Field Service Operations teams manage recurring services and validate billing arrangements 
 

 
 
 
Business Process Flow:
BPF stages: Origination, Manager (for some groups), Routing, In-Process, Finalize
 

 *  Sales Rep navigates to an Account in CRM 
 *  Sales Rep creates TSR in CRM. 
 *  Selects TSR group, type, application area, and unit. 
 *  Inputs cost center and pack code (if applicable). 
 *  Specifies business status (new, existing, jeopardy), issue, and scope. 
 *  TSR is routed to manager (if required) and then to TRM. 
 *  TRM approves and assigns SME. 
 *  TSR may include travel approval and risk assessment. 
 *  TSR is finalized with classification and optional attachments 
 

 
 
Downstream Systems/Integration:

 *  TSRs link to CRM master data and drive service visit creation. 
 *  Integration with SAP for service orders via SAP Work Center codes. 
 *  Billing arrangements (BA) are validated and linked to TSRs. 
 *  Value Added Services (VAS) may be created from TSRs or service activities  
 

 
Impact Considerations:
 

 *  TSR Originator form in CRM has a quick view form showing “Global Business” field.   
 *  TSRs rely on SAP Work Center codes, which will be replaced by EBS Work Center codes. A mapping exercise is required to update existing recurring service orders  
 *  Billing Arrangements (BA) will continue to exist post-EBS migration, but the integration strategy and data feed updates are still under discussion. 
 *  There’s a need to determine how to handle field service users who are not aligned to district teams, as they lack sales skill or district attributes that drive current logic 
 *  Field visibility and requirements are driven by: 

 *  Global Business (currently visible, future state hidden). 
 *  Sales Skill (to replace Global Business for field logic). 
 *  TSR Group (determines required fields like pack code). 
 *  Stage of TSR (fields may become mandatory at later stages). 
 *  Harmonization aims to standardize forms and reduce discrepancies between divisions 
 

 *  Existing separate project is doing this. Not in R2scope. No eta on project timeline.

849587,Requirement,,,,,CRM: Enable Sales Skill–Based Logic and Future Harmonization for Technical Service Request (TSR) Process,,,,"As part of the One Customer (1C) initiative, Ecolab aims to harmonize the Technical Service Request (TSR) process across Water, Food & Beverage (Hygiene), and Life Science divisions to ensure a unified, consistent user experience and to prepare the platform for cross-divisional service standardization.

 
Today, TSR behavior (forms, approvals, field requirements, and reporting) differs across divisions: 

 *  Nalco Water requires PAC Code and Cost Center, and includes a Manager Approval stage. 
 *  Food & Beverage (Hygiene) excludes those fields and omits Manager Approval. 
 *  Life Science adds an additional Motivation step linking TSRs to Opportunities, TVD Programs, or RTW records. 
 *  Additionally, field visibility is currently controlled by Global Business, which will no longer be reliable under the 1C model. 
 

 
To align TSRs with the One Customer model and future-proof system behavior: 

 *  Global Business–based logic must be replaced by Sales Skill–driven logic. 
 *  UI components (like the Account Quick View on TSR) must dynamically display Sales Skill for 1C accounts. 
 *  A technical spike must first identify all field, BPF, and approval flow differences, as well as harmonization feasibility and effort estimates for implementation in a future release. 
 

 
This requirement establishes the foundation for harmonizing TSRs and ensuring that 1C-related accounts are fully integrated with the Sales Skill–based architecture. 

 
Business Objectives 

 *  Create a unified and flexible TSR process compatible with One Customer (1C) architecture. 
 *  Replace outdated Global Business logic with Sales Skill for all 1C accounts. 
 *  Enable accurate filtering, field visibility, and approval routing across divisions. 
 *  Prepare CRM for future TSR harmonization and consistent reporting across all business units. 
 

 
Scope 

 *  In Scope: 

 *  All divisions currently using TSR (Nalco Water, F&B Hygiene, Life Science). 
 *  CRM form changes (Quick View adjustments, field visibility, BPF review). 
 *  Technical spike to analyze harmonization feasibility, configuration, and effort. 
 *  Preparation for future R3 harmonization implementation. 
 

 *  Out of Scope (for R2): 

 *  Actual harmonization of TSR workflows and approval processes.

869642,User Story,,,,,,Technical Spike – Assess Feasibility and Effort for Harmonization of Technical Service Request (TSR) Process Across Divisions,,,"As a Solution and Technical Architect,
I want to conduct a detailed technical analysis of the Technical Service Request (TSR) process across Nalco Water, Food & Beverage (Hygiene), and Life Science,
 
so that we can determine the changes, effort, and dependencies required to harmonize the TSR entity, business process flow, and field visibility/requirement logic into a single standardized configuration for future One Customer (1C) enablement.
 

 
Context and Background 
The TSR module is used by multiple Ecolab divisions to document, approve, and execute technical service activities. 
While the process intent is similar, each division follows different configurations, resulting in inconsistent behavior, reporting, and approval flows:
 

 *  Nalco Water: 

 *  Includes a Manager Approval stage. 
 *  Requires Cost Center and PAC Code fields. 
 

 *  Food & Beverage (Hygiene): 

 *  No Manager Approval stage. 
 *  Cost Center and PAC Code are not required. 
 

 *  Life Science: 

 *  Adds an additional Motivation step for linking TSRs to Opportunity, TVD Program, or Retain-to-Win (RTW). 
 

 

 
The long-term goal is to harmonize these differences so all divisions follow a unified TSR process, ensuring consistent data and user experience across Ecolab. 
However, full harmonization is not part of R2 scope — instead, this technical spike aims to analyze feasibility, enumerate all process and configuration differences, and estimate the effort required for implementation in a future release (R3 or later).
 

 
Objectives of the Spike 

 *  Catalog field-level differences (visibility, requirement, default values, conditional logic). 
 *  Identify where PAC Code and Cost Center are required, hidden, or optional. 
 *  Compare Business Process Flow (BPF) configurations, stages, and transition rules across divisions. 
 *  Assess how Sales Skill can replace Global Business for field visibility and requirement logic in 1C. 
 *  Evaluate approval logic (Manager Approval vs. SME Approval) and its technical implementation. 
 *  Document data model and integration dependencies (EBS, reporting). 
 *  Estimate effort and outline a recommended harmonization approach for future release. 
 

 
Deliverables 

 *  Field-Level Comparison Matrix: Required/optional/hidden fields by division (Water, F&B, Life Science). 
 *  BPF Comparison Document: Stage names, transitions, and conditional logic across divisions. 
 *  Visibility Logic Mapping: Transition from Global Business–based logic to Sales Skill–based logic. 
 *  Harmonization Approach Proposal: Options for unifying TSR forms, workflows, and approvals. 
 *  Effort and Risk Estimate: Configuration, development, regression, and testing effort. 
 *  Summary Report: Documented findings and next-step recommendations. 
 

 

","Chopra, Ashish",Pending PO Review,,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.06,2,Moved out of state In Development,Business,3,"Business Acceptance Criteria 

 *  Scenario 1 – Field-Level Comparison Across Divisions 

 *  Given that each division (Water, F&B, Life Science) has different field configurations, 
 *  When the spike analysis is conducted, 
 *  Then the output must clearly list for each field whether it is: 

 *  Required 
 *  Optional 
 *  Hidden 
 *  Conditional (depends on stage or role) 
 *  And specifically identify where PAC Code and Cost Center are mandatory vs. not used. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 2 – Business Process Flow (BPF) Mapping 

 *  Given that divisions use distinct BPFs, 
 *  When the stages and approval flows are analyzed, 
 *  Then the documentation must highlight all stage-level differences, including: 
 *  Presence/absence of Manager Approval 
 *  Motivation step linkage in Life Science 
 *  Field requirement changes per stage. 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Harmonization Feasibility and Effort Estimation 

 *  Given that all differences have been cataloged, 
 *  When the team reviews dependencies and configuration effort, 
 *  Then the spike must provide: 

 *  Estimated story-point or hour effort for each harmonization component, 
 *  Identified risks, and 
 *  Technical feasibility summary. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 4 – Reporting and Downstream Impact 

 *  Given that unified reporting is an expected outcome of harmonization, 
 *  When the team reviews data models and reporting integrations, 
 *  Then the output must indicate: 
 *  Current reporting limitations, 
 *  Required data alignment (Snowflake/Power BI), and 
 *  Regression-testing impacts. 
 

 *  Completion Criteria 

 *  Comparative analysis and proposed harmonization approach reviewed with Kathleen (PO) and core technical leads (Shamil, Arpit, Zahara). 
 *  Findings documented in Confluence/SharePoint and linked to the R2 technical backlog. 
 *  Review session conducted to finalize harmonization recommendations and effort sizing.

849456,Feature,,,,CRM: Tank Orders Process,,,,,"Business Purpose/Context
 
 
 
 
 
D365 Tank Order is used by Sales Reps to capture Tank Order details and facilitate order approval.
Volume: 60 new Base Tank (PORTA-feed) orders per month. 90% USA, 10% Canada.
The Tank Order Process is a feature within the F&B United CRM system designed to manage the end-to-end lifecycle of tank orders, primarily for Base Tank (PORTA-feed) and Bulk Tank types.

 
Tank Order Types & Definitions 
 

 *  Two main Order Types: Base Tank (PORTA-feed) and Bulk Tank.  
 *  Three Request Types: New, Product Change, Label Change. 
 *  Label changes are increasing due to EVD standards. 
 *  Base Tank (PORTA-feed) represents the bulk of Tank Orders.  
 

 
Key Functionalities: 
- Manual entry of tank serial numbers, product setup, and label Adjust CRM views and workflows to support new matching logic. 
- Retain manual approval steps until automation is feasible. 
- Manual entry of tank serial numbers, product setup, and label requirements. 
- Embedded safety and delivery checklists (currently manual). 
- Mandatory fields include Ship-To Sold -To address and delivery info. 
- Ship-To Sold -To logic is restrictive—only one pre-existing address can be selected per order 

Integration & Data Management: 
- No current integration with NSAP/EBS; master data duplication expected. 
- CRM must support dual maintenance of customer and tank records across EBS and NSAP. 
- Legacy account numbers and mapping logic need updates for post-EBS migration. 
- Mapping between EBS Ship-To and NSAP intercompany Ship-To is a critical challenge. 

 
Workflow & Approvals: 
- Business Process Flow (BPF) manages approvals. 
- Reviewer/Approver is assigned by matching Ship-To Zip Code with Base Tank Plants table Zip Code. 
- CRM automates warehouse assignment and hazardous product checks using static reference tables. 
- Fulfillment involves 6–7 functional groups (logistics, safety, compliance, warehousing). 
- Final step (""Customer Setup"") pushes Tank Order data to downstream systems (manual today). 
 
 

 *  Business Process Flow (BPF) manages approvals, but actual fulfillment steps remain manual. 
 *  Varies per Order and Request Type 
 *  Longest for Order Type = Base Tank 
 *  At end of step “Customer Steup” the Tank Order data, including Ship-To, flows out of D365 to downstream systems t0 Prepare Tank. (Manually done today 
 *  CRM automates warehouse assignment and hazardous product checks but relies on static reference tables Base Tank Plants & Base Tank Sizes (zip - warehouse). 
 *  Approvals trigger CRM queues, but no downstream automation or automated messaging exists today. 
 *  Reviewer/Approver is assigned by matching the Tank Orders table Ship-To Zip Code value with the Base Tank Plants table Zip value. 
 *  Tank order fulfillment involves 6–7 functional groups across warehousing, logistics, safety, and compliance. 
 

 

 
 
Sales Rep Experience 

 *  Current CRM flow requires multiple manual steps with mandatory fields, ship-to logic, and delivery info. 
 *  Safety and delivery checklists are embedded but heavily manual. 
 *  Ship-To is restricted to one pre-existing Ship-To address per tank order. 
 *  Tank Delivery Business Phone field is not linked to a Contact or Address record. 
 

 

 
 
MasterData Management

 *  Tankserial numbers, bulk tank setup, and product changes are all manually enteredin CRM. 
 *  Nointegration with NSAP/EBS yet; master data duplication is expected. 
 

 
EBS/NSAP Dual Maintenance (Post-Migration) 

 *  Customers, ship-to, and bill-to will exist in both EBS and NSAP, requiring mapping. 
 *  EBS is the system of record, NSAP continues for fulfillment until phased out. 
 *  Mapping between ship-to in EBS and intercompany ship-to in NSAP is a critical technical challenge. 
 *  Tank and ship-to data must be synchronized across CRM, EBS, and NSAP. 
 *  Dual account numbers must be supported (EBS + NSAP). 
 *  Existing CRM logic (e.g., “legacy account number”) will need updates to handle dual mappings. 
 

 


 

BUSINESS PROCESS FLOW:

Tank Order Business Process Flow (As-Is) 

1. Initiation 

 *  Persona: Sales Representative 
 *  Action: Creates a new Tank Order in D365 CRM. 
 *  Details: Selects Order Type (Base Tank or Bulk Tank) and Request Type (New, Product Change, Label Change).  
 

2. Data Entry 

 *  Persona: Sales Representative 
 *  Action: Inputs mandatory fields including Ship-To address, delivery info, and tank details. 
 *  Details: Manual entry of tank serial numbers, product setup, and label requirements.  
 

3. Safety & Delivery Checks 

 *  Persona: Sales Representative + Safety & Compliance Team 
 *  Action: Completes embedded checklists for hazardous product handling and delivery safety. 
 *  Details: Manual process; no automated validation.  
 

4. Approval Routing 

 *  Step: Approval Routing 
 *  Persona: Reviewer/Approver 
 *  Action: CRM routes the Tank Order for approval. 
 *  Logic: The system matches the Ship-To Zip Code from the Tank Orders table with the Zip Code in the Base Tank Plants table. 
 *  Purpose: This determines the appropriate reviewer/approver and initiates CRM queue routing. 
 *  Note: This step currently relies on static reference tables and manual fulfillment.  
 

5. Customer Setup Completion 

 *  Persona: Sales Operations 
 *  Action: Finalizes customer setup and pushes data downstream. 
 *  Details: Ship-To and tank data flow out of CRM to prepare the tank manually.  
 

6. Warehouse Assignment 

 *  Persona: Warehouse Coordinator 
 *  Action: Assigns warehouse based on Zip Code logic. 
 *  Details: Uses static reference tables (Base Tank Plants & Sizes). 
 

7. Tank Fulfillment 

 *  Persona: Logistics, Safety, Compliance, and Warehouse Teams 
 *  Action: Coordinates tank delivery and setup. 
 *  Details: Involves 6–7 functional groups; fulfillment is manual.  
 

8. Post-Order Integration (Currently this is manual. Ecolab wants this automated.) 

 *  Persona: CRM Admin / Integration Specialist 
 *  Action: Syncs data between CRM, EBS, and NSAP. 
 *  Details: Dual maintenance of customer and tank records; legacy account numbers supported.
 
 *  After the ""Customer Setup"" step, Tank Order data (including Ship-To) flows out of D365 CRM to downstream systems to prepare the tank.  

 *  Customer Setup Group opens NSAP Customer record, creates an Equipment record, associates the product and bask tank to the Equipment record.  
 *  Some sort of approval occurs 
 *  Then, TBD is manually updated in CRM.  
 *  Business to determine EBS/NSAP/CRM data flow needs such as in which system does the Tank record setup begin.  
 

 *  This integration is not automated and lacks messaging or queue management.  
 *  CRM currently supports manual dual maintenance of customer and tank records between EBS and NSAP, including legacy account numbers. 

 


 

Dual Maintenance:

1. Customers, Ship-To, and Bill-To Exist in Both Systems
 
   - Ensures CRM can access and validate customer data regardless of which system it's stored in.
 
   - Prevents order failures due to missing or mismatched customer records.
 

 
2. EBS Is the System of Record; NSAP Continues for Fulfillment
 
   - EBS holds authoritative data, but NSAP still executes deliveries.
 
   - Dual maintenance allows both systems to function in parallel until NSAP is fully phased out.
 

 
3. Mapping Between Ship-To in EBS and Intercompany Ship-To in NSAP
 
   - Critical for accurate fulfillment and warehouse assignment.
 
   - Avoids delivery errors and ensures compliance with logistics protocols.
 

 
4. Synchronization Across CRM, EBS, and NSAP
 
   - Keeps tank and customer data aligned across platforms.
 
   - Supports seamless order processing, approval routing, and fulfillment.
 

 
5. Support for Dual Account Numbers (EBS + NSAP)
 
   - Enables CRM users to reference either system depending on business context.
 
   - Facilitates legacy data access and historical tracking.
 

 
6. Updates to Existing CRM Logic (e.g., Legacy Account Number)
 
   - Necessary to handle dual mappings and prevent logic failures.
 
   - Ensures CRM workflows remain functional and accurate during the transition.

EBS/NSAP Dual Maintenance (Post-Migration) 

 *  Customers, ship-to, and bill-to will exist in both EBS and NSAP, requiring mapping. 
 *  EBS is the system of record, NSAP continues for fulfillment until phased out. 
 *  Mapping between ship-to in EBS and intercompany ship-to in NSAP is a critical technical challenge. 
 *  Tank and ship-to data must be synchronized across CRM, EBS, and NSAP. 
 *  Dual account numbers must be supported (EBS + NSAP). 
 *  Existing CRM logic (e.g., “legacy account number”) will need updates to handle dual mappings. 
 

 

 
Business Justification: 
 

 *  The importance of EBS/NSAP Dual Maintenance (Post-Migration) lies in ensuring operational continuity, data integrity, and system interoperability during a phased transition from NSAP to EBS. 
 *  Dual maintenance is a strategic safeguard to ensure that tank orders, customer setups, and fulfillment operations continue smoothly while the enterprise migrates from NSAP to EBS. 
 *  Customers, Ship-To, and Bill-To records will exist in both EBS and NSAP. 
 *  EBS will serve as the system of record, while NSAP continues to fulfill orders until fully phased out. 
 *  Accurate mapping between EBS Ship-To and NSAP intercompany Ship-To is essential for fulfillment and supply chain continuity. 
 

Functional Requirements: 

 *  Dual Record Support 

 *  CRM must support dual maintenance of customer and tank records across EBS and NSAP. 
 *  Legacy account numbers must be retained and referenced. 
 

 *  Mapping Logic 
 

 

 *  Implement logic to map Ship-To and Sold-To between EBS and NSAP. 
 *  Ensure mapping supports both Canada and US go-live scenarios. 
 

 *  CRM Logic Updates 
 

 

 *  Update existing CRM logic (e.g., “legacy account number” fields) to handle dual mappings. 
 *  Adjust CRM views and workflows to reflect both systems. 
 

 *  Data Synchronization 
 

 

 *  Ensure tank and Ship-To data are synchronized across CRM, EBS, and NSAP. 
 *  Validate mapping accuracy in QA/Staging environments before go-live. 
 

 *  Interface Documentation 
 

 

 *  Provide technical documentation for EBS/NSAP mapping interfaces. 
 

 

 

 
Non-Functional Requirements: 

 *  Maintain data integrity across systems. 
 *  Ensure compatibility with manual approval steps until automation is feasible. 
 *  Support future automation of notifications and queue management. 
 

 
Dependencies: 
 

 *  Technical spike for Ship-To handling (Siva / Carol). 
 *  Legacy data retention review (Siddharth). 
 *  Mapping documentation (Megan). 
 *  QA/Staging validation (Team). 
 

 
Why Dual Maintenance Is Critical: 
1. Customers, Ship-To, and Bill-To Exist in Both Systems  

 *  Ensures CRM can access and validate customer data regardless of which system it's stored in.  
 *  Prevents order failures due to missing or mismatched customer records. 
 

2. EBS Is the System of Record; NSAP Continues for Fulfillment  

 *  EBS holds authoritative data, but NSAP still executes deliveries.  
 *  Dual maintenance allows both systems to function in parallel until NSAP is fully phased out. 
 

3. Mapping Between Ship-To in EBS and Intercompany Ship-To in NSAP  

 *  Critical for accurate fulfillment and warehouse assignment.  
 *  Avoids delivery errors and ensures compliance with logistics protocols. 
 

4. Synchronization Across CRM, EBS, and NSAP  

 *  Keeps tank and customer data aligned across platforms.  
 *  Supports seamless order processing, approval routing, and fulfillment. 
 

5. Support for Dual Account Numbers (EBS + NSAP)  

 *  Enables CRM users to reference either system depending on business context.  
 *  Facilitates legacy data access and historical tracking. 
 

6. Updates to Existing CRM Logic (e.g., Legacy Account Number)  

 *  Necessary to handle dual mappings and prevent logic failures.

885572,User Story,,,,,,Technical Spike: Design & Recommend Customer Service Notification Mechanism (Per-Order vs Daily Summary) for Tank Orders,,,"As a technical team,
I need to analyze and design the best solution to automatically notify the Customer Service team when a tank order reaches the Customer Setup workflow stage,
 
so that business can receive timely alerts and take appropriate action on new, label, and product-change tank orders.
 

 
Context and Background: 
Today:

 *  Customer Service monitors tank orders manually via dashboards. 
 *  No automated notification is sent when an order reaches the Customer Setup stage. 
 *  The business prefers automated notifications and wants a clear understanding of: 

 *  Trigger definition 
 *  When the email should fire 
 *  Who should receive the notification 
 *  Per-order email vs daily summary 
 *  Standardized email subject + body formatting 
 

 *  Business’ initial preference: 

 *  Per-order notification (one email per tank order reaching Customer Setup). 
 

 *  However: 

 *  The technical feasibility, complexity, cost, performance impact, and maintainability must be evaluated. 
 *  Daily summary notification (batch model) may still be considered depending on effort, reliability, and scalability. 
 

 

 
This spike must evaluate both models, document the findings, and provide a final recommendation. 
 

 
","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,TECHNICAL SPIKE,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.17.02,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,1,"Scope of Analysis

 *  This spike must review, analyze, and document: 

 *  Trigger Logic (When to send the notification) 
 *  Determine the exact workflow stage: Customer Setup stage in the tank order BPF. 
 *  Determine if any edge conditions exist: 

 *  Order reopened 
 *  Order resubmitted 
 *  Order modified after Customer Setup 
 

 *  Confirm whether a notification is required only on first entry into the stage or on any change. 
 *  Targeted Tank Order Types 

 *  New Tank 
 *  Product Change 
 *  Label-Only 
 

 

 *  Notification Modalities to Evaluate 

 *  Per-Order Immediate Notification 
 *  Triggered instantly when order enters Customer Setup stage. 
 *  Emails sent one-by-one. 
 *  Requires evaluating: 
 *  Plugin vs Power Automate 
 *  Performance 
 *  Reliability 
 *  Outlook mail limits 
 *  Logging/audit needs 
 

 *  Daily Summary Notification 

 *  A scheduled process identifies all tank orders in Customer Setup. 
 *  Sends one consolidated email. 
 *  Requires evaluating: 
 *  Batch job scheduling 
 *  Data reliability 
 *  Formatting the summary 
 *  File export vs inline table 
 

 *  Email Formatting & Content 
 *  Provide recommended formatting including: 

 *  Subject Line Template 
 *  e.g., “Tank Order Ready for Customer Setup – Request #{{OrderNumber}} – {{CustomerName}}” 
 *  Body Template 
 *  Should include: 
 *  Tank Order ID 
 *  Request Type 
 *  Customer Account Name / Sold-To 
 *  Ship-To 
 *  Product Information 
 *  Date Submitted 
 *  Link to open the tank order in CRM 
 *  Any additional metadata recommended by UX/Operations 
 

 *  Delivery Mechanism Evaluated 

 *  Spike must analyze feasibility of: 

 *  Power Automate Flow (Cloud Flow triggered by Dataverse) 
 *  Scheduled job (for daily summary) 
 *  Any dependency on dashboards or workflow logs 
 

 

 *  Recipient Mapping 

 *  Confirm: 

 *  Distribution list 
 *  Static email addresses 
 *  Or dynamic based on region/district/customer type 
 

 

 *  Pros & Cons Comparison 

 *  Full evaluation should include: 

 *  Technical feasibility 
 *  Cost/effort 
 *  Maintainability 
 *  Supportability 
 *  Error handling 
 *  Performance 
 *  Impact on Customer Service 
 *  Scalability for future R2+ 
 *  Risk mitigation 
 

 

 *  Final Recommendation 

 *  Identify preferred mechanism (likely Per Order Notification) 
 *  Justify the recommendation 
 *  Provide a recommended implementation approach

883234,User Story,,,,,,Send Automated Notification When Tank Order Appears in Customer Setup Queue (Dependent on Technical Spike #885572),,,"As a Customer Service user,
I want to automatically receive a notification when a tank order meets the system-defined criteria for the Customer Setup stage,
 
so that I can review new tank, product change, or label-only requests promptly without relying solely on dashboard monitoring.
 

 
Context and Background  

 *  CRM currently identifies tank orders requiring customer-service action using the TankOrderCustomerSetup view. 
 *  This view includes only orders that meet a very specific set of conditions. 
 *  Today, Customer Service monitors this view manually. 
 *  No automated notification exists. 
 *  The business now requires email notifications triggered when a tank order qualifies for Customer Setup. 
 *  Two notification models remain under consideration: 

 *  Per-Order Event-Triggered Email 
 *  Daily Summary Email 
 

 *  The technical spike #885572  will confirm which model is feasible/preferred. 
 *  This story documents acceptance criteria for both. 
 *  Trigger Criteria 

 *  A tank order must trigger notification only if ALL of the following conditions are true: 

 *  From TankOrder (Parent Entity) 
 *  Status = Active 
 *  Order Status = Customer Setup Pending 
 *  Sales Org ? {1001, 2001, 1500, 2500, US10, CA10} 
 *  (NOTE: Sales org update will be handled in a separate story. For this story, assume the view already includes the correct list.) 
 *  From TankOrderStatusTracker (Related Entity) 
 *  Status = Active 
 *  Record Status = Open 
 *  Request Type = Customer Setup 
 

 *  If a tank order appears in the TankOrderCustomerSetup view as a result of the above filters, it is considered ready for customer setup and must be included in the notification (either event-based or daily). 
 

 *  Required Email Content (Both Models) 

 *  Each tank order in the notification must include: 
 *  Order Type (New Tank / Product Change / New Label Only) 
 *  Request Type 
 *  Sold-To Account Number & Name 
 *  Ship-To Account Number & Name 
 *  NSAP Intercompany Ship-To Number (If available) 
 *  Tank Delivery Business Phone 
 *  CRM Record Link

 *  Option A – Event-Based Notification (Per Order) 

 *  Trigger When Order Qualifies for Customer Setup 

 *  Given a tank order meets all criteria defined in the TankOrderCustomerSetup view (status = active, order status = customer setup pending, etc.) 
 *  When the record first appears in the view and it is for a 1C account 
 *  Then an automated email must be sent immediately to Customer Service cs-watercare@ecolab.com.  
 

 *  Ensure One Notification Per Order 

 *  Given the tank order remains in customer setup pending 
 *  When the user opens/edits/saves the order 
 *  Then no additional notifications should be sent. 
 

 *  Email Content Requirements 

 *  Given the notification is generated 
 *  Then the email must include: 

 *  Order Type 
 *  Request Type 
 *  Sold-To Account Number & Name 
 *  Ship-To Account Number & Name 
 *  NSAP Intercompany Ship-To Number 
 *  Tank Delivery Business Phone 
 *  CRM Record Link 
 

 

 *  Email Subject & Body Formatting 

 *  Subject Example: 

 *  Tank Order Ready for Customer Setup – {{OrderName}} 
 

 *  Body must include: 

 *  Header identifying tank order 
 *  Attribute/value list (clean layout) 
 *  CRM hyperlink 
 *  No technical IDs visible to business users

883227,User Story,,,,,,CRM – Update Label Information Fields on Tank Order Detail Form for 1C Accounts (EVD label updates),,,"As a CRM user working on a tank order,
I need the Label Information section on the Tank Order Detail form to show EBS-based label product numbers and descriptions
 
instead of the legacy NSAP label fields,
 
so that the correct EBS product references are used for new tank, product change, and label-only workflows for 1C customer accounts.
 

 
Context and Background

 *  Today, the Label Information tab shows 8 NSAP product number fields, each named using the pattern: 

 *  NSAPProductNumber – Description 
 

 *  For the 1C program, label requests must transition to EBS product numbers, and only 6 out of 8 NSAP fields have EBS equivalents. 
 *  Business has provided a mapping list (6 EBS product numbers + descriptions). 
 *  Two NSAP label fields have no EBS equivalents and must be removed for 1C accounts. 
 *  For non-1C accounts, the existing NSAP fields must remain unchanged. 
 *  Scope of Change 

 *  Current (Today — NSAP Fields Displayed for All Accounts) 

 *  The Label Information tab contains 8 fields, each representing NSAP product codes. 

 *  241-P0208.88- ABEL LAMINATED 8X11 PRODUCT 
 *  241-P3317.88- LABEL TANK KIT COMPLETE WITH LABEL BOARD

 *  241-P3374.88-LABEL TANK FILL LINE LABELS (2/SET) 
 *  241-P3389.88-LABEL EVD CONNECTION POINT LABEL 
 

 

 *  Future (Required — EBS Fields Displayed for 1C Only) 

 *  For 1C Accounts 

 *  The 8 NSAP label fields must be hidden/suppressed 
 *  6 new EBS label fields must be shown 
 *  Field labels must follow the pattern: EBS Product Number – Description 

 *  53003339- LABEL EVD CONNECTION POINT LABEL

 *  Given the user selects a product on the Tank Order Details Form, 
 *  And the Tank Order is created for a non-1C customer, 
 *  When the form loads the product selection, 
 *  Then the NSAP legacy product quick view must not be shown. 
 

 *  
 

 

 

 
Dependencies: 

 *  Story #872853 – Add Legacy Product Lookup to Product Table 
 *  Mapping between EBS Product ? NSAP Product must already exist. 
 *  This story relies on that lookup field for the Quick View display. 
 


 

 
Dev Notes:  

 *  Validate the ecl_oldproductnumber field  

 *  Given the system has the Tank Order Detail Table,  
 *  When reviewing the field ecl_oldproductnumber,  
 *  Then confirm whether the field is still required,  
 *  And document how is it used for Product Change requests.

Context (How Users Can Create Tank Orders in CRM)

 *  Creating a Tank Order From an Account ? Tank Orders Tab ? New 

 *  User opens an Account record. 
 *  On Water accounts, the Tank Orders tab is visible. 
 *  User clicks + New, which opens a Tank Order with the Account pre-populated. 
 *  The user can change the pre-populated account, so the system must re-check eligibility. 
 

 *  Creating a Tank Order from Sitemap ? Tank Orders ? New 

 *  User navigates to the Tank Orders view. 
 *  User clicks + New and selects an Account on the form. 
 

 

 
 
In all of these entry points, the selected Account must be validated to ensure it is an eligible Nalco Water account.

 *  Given the user clicks New from the Tank Orders sitemap, 
 *  When the user selects an Account, 
 *  Then filter the Sold To Account Dropdown to only display Accounts with Sales Skill = Water (1C) or Global Business = Nalco Water (Non-1C) 
 

 *  Restriction When Creating From an Account ? Tank Orders Tab ? New and User Changes the Pre-Populated Account  

 *  Given the user opens a Water account and clicks + New under the Tank Orders tab,  
 *  When the Tank Order opens with the Account pre-populated,   
 *  When the user changes the Account to a different one,  
 *  Then the system must validate whether the Account is Water Account  
 *  And prevent the user from proceeding if the account is not a Water account:  

 *  For 1C Account validate if Sales Skill ? Water then trigger this validation
  
 *  For non 1C account validate if Global Business ? Nalco Water then trigger this validation  
 

 *  And block creation and show error message:  

 *  “Tank Orders can only be created for Water accounts.”  
 

 

 *  Validation Always Runs on Account Selection  

 *  Given the Tank Order form is open (from sitemap or account),  
 *  When the Account field is populated or changed,

885571,User Story,,,,,,"CRM – Lock product, serial, and equipment number fields on “New Label” tank order requests once tank is selected",,,"As a CRM user submitting a Label-Only tank order request,
I need the Product Number, Serial Number, and Equipment Number to be auto-populated from the selected tank and locked (read-only),
 
so that label-only requests do not accidentally modify tank-level product details that were established during the original tank setup.
 

 
Context and Background: 

 *  When a New Tank request is submitted: 

 *  User enters product information on the Tank Order Detail form 
 *  CRM automatically creates a Tank record behind the scenes 
 *  The tank stores: 

 *  Product number 
 *  Serial number 
 *  Equipment number 
 *  Unloading point 
 *  Additional tank attributes 
 

 *  These values represent the authoritative product configuration for that tank. 
 

 *  What Happens for Label-Only Requests 

 *  When a user submits a Label-Only request, they are not requesting to change the tank’s product or configuration. 
 *  They are only requesting: 

 *  A new label, 
 *  Or a corrected/replacement label. 
 

 

 *  Risk Without Locking 

 *  If CRM continues to allow edits to Product Number, Serial Number, or Equipment Number during a Label-Only request: 
 *  Users may modify tank data unintentionally 
 *  It creates inconsistencies between: 

 *  The tank order 
 *  The Tank record 
 *  NSAP/EBS equipment data 
 

 *  It leads to incorrect product labeling and operational errors 
 

 *  Why Locking Is Required 

 *  Business requires that Label-Only = No changes to tank metadata. 
 *  Therefore: 
 

 *  When a tank is selected on a Label-Only request: 
 *  All identifying fields must be read-only 
 *  No changes should be permitted unless the user explicitly submits a Product Change request type instead 
 

 *  This ensures data integrity for tank master data and preserves the workflow separation between: 
 

 *  Product Change (modifications to tank metadata) 

 *  Label Only (no tank metadata changes allowed) 
 

 *  Scope of Change 

 *  Applies To: 

 *  Label-Only tank order requests 
 *  1C and non-1C customers (same behavior for both) 
 

 

 *  Fields to Lock (Label-Only): 

 *  Product Number 
 *  Serial Number 
 *  Equipment Number (newly displayed) 
 

 *  Fields to Remain Editable (Non-Label Types): 

 *  Product Number and Serial Number remain editable for: 

 *  New Tank 
 *  Product Change 
 

 *  Equipment Number must not appear

 *  Product Number must be locked for Label-Only 

 *  Given the tank order request type = Label Only 
 *  And the user selects a tank 
 *  When the Product Number auto-populates from the tank 
 *  Then Product Number must be read-only 
 *  And user must not be able to edit it. 
 

 *  Serial Number must be locked for Label-Only 

 *  Given request type = Label Only 
 *  When the tank is selected 
 *  Then Serial Number auto-populates 
 *  And the field must be read-only. 
 

 *  Equipment Number must be displayed and locked 

 *  Given request type = Label Only 
 *  When a tank is selected 
 *  Then show the Equipment Number field 
 *  And auto-populate it from the tank 
 *  And lock it as read-only. 
 

 

 *  Enforcement regardless of 1C or non-1C 

 *  Given label-only requests can occur on any account 
 *  When the request type = Label Only 
 *  Then all locking rules must apply uniformly.

885569,User Story,,,,,,CRM – Auto-populate Ship-To and display NSAP intercompany Ship-To for 1C tank orders,,,"As a CRM user creating a tank order for a 1C customer,
 
 
I want CRM to automatically populate (and lock) the Ship-To value when a selected Sold-To is linked to only one Ship-To,
 
and I want the NSAP Intercompany Ship-To number to display in the Ship-To quick view,
 
so that I can correctly identify NSAP cross-references required for NSAP downstream processing.
 

 
Work Details:

 *  New Field Needed 

 *  Add new field on Account: NSAP Intercompany Ship-To 
 *  Populated by integration 
 *  Must be included in the Ship-To/Sold-To quick view 
 *  This New Field should appear on the Admin tab of the Account Form 
 

 *  Behavior for 1C vs Non-1C Customers 

 *  1C = Show NSAP Intercompany Ship-To 
 *  Non-1C = Hide or show blank (depending on feasibility) 
 

 *  Auto-Populate + Lock Logic 

 *  If Sold-To has exactly 1 Ship-To, CRM must: 

 *  Auto-populate Ship-To 
 *  Lock the Ship-To lookup field (user cannot change it) 
 

 *  If Sold-To has multiple Ship-Tos, CRM must: 

 *  Not auto-populate 
 *  Keep the field unlocked to allow selection 
 

 

 *  Quick View Updates 

 *  After Ship-To is set (auto or user selection): 
 *  Show NSAP Intercompany Ship-To immediately under Ship-To number 
 *  Other fields remain unchanged

 *  New Account field exists 

 *  Given the Account (Ship-To) record exists, 
 *  When viewing it in CRM, 
 *  Then a field named NSAP Intercompany Ship-To must exist and be available for integration. 
 

 *  Auto-populate Ship-To when Sold-To has one Ship-To 

 *  Given a Sold-To account has exactly one Ship-To linked, 
 *  When the user selects this Sold-To on the Tank Order form, 
 *  Then CRM must automatically populate the Ship-To field with that one record. 
 

 *  Lock Ship-To field when auto-populated 

 *  Given the Ship-To field has been auto-populated because the Sold-To has one Ship-To, 
 *  When the user attempts to edit the Ship-To lookup, 
 *  Then the field must be locked, preventing manual changes. 
 

 *  Allow manual selection when multiple Ship-Tos exist 

 *  Given a Sold-To has more than one Ship-To, 
 *  When the user selects that Sold-To, 
 *  Then the Ship-To field must remain unlocked, 
 *  And the user must select one from the dropdown. 
 

 *  Display NSAP Intercompany Ship-To for 1C customers 

 *  Given a Tank Order is created for a 1C account, 
 *  When the Ship-To quick view loads, 
 *  Then the NSAP Intercompany Ship-To field must display its value 
 *  And appear directly below the Ship-To number. 
 

 *  Update the Public View Active Accounts Ship To  View to add the Intercompany Ship To Number  

 *  Given I view the Active Accounts Ship To  View  
 *  When the  view loads, 
 *  Then the NSAP Intercompany Ship-To field must be added to this view  
 *  And appear after the Ship-To number. 
 

 

 *  Suppress NSAP Intercompany Ship-To for non-1C 

 *  Given a Tank Order is created for a non-1C account, 
 *  When the Ship-To quick view loads, 
 *  Then CRM must either: 

 *  Hide the NSAP Intercompany Ship-To (ideal), or 
 *  Show the field with blank value (fallback). 
 

 

 *  Quick view refreshes when Ship-To changes 

 *  Given a user changes the Sold-To or adjusts the Ship-To selection, 
 *  When the new Ship-To is set, 
 *  Then the quick view must refresh 
 *  And display the correct NSAP intercompany Ship-To for that Ship-To. 
 

 

Technical Note:- 

 *  The field should have same metadata as Account Number field.  
 *  The schema name should be ecl_znsapidentifier and the display name should be NSAP Intercompany Ship-To Number 
 *  This new field on the Account table should be added the Key Change Log (Plugin updates needed (Secure configs need to be modified))

850715,Feature,,,,CRM: Service - District Services - Handle Unified Service Templates for 1C Org accounts,,,,," 
Context 
 
 
The Reoccurring Services for District Team functionality within the Service Plan Builder Power App enables Sales Representatives (Reps) and District Managers (DMs) to define and automate service schedules for customer accounts. These services are based on predefined templates or customized inputs and are tied to specific assets or sites. The goal is to ensure consistent service delivery, reduce manual effort, and align with the Statement of Work (SOW) commitments made by Corporate Account Managers (CAMs) to customers. 

Business Value:
This feature streamlines service planning and execution across Water and Hygiene divisions, improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. It supports harmonized workflows and ensures alignment between sales commitments and field execution.

 
Groups
Hygiene & Water 
Personas
• Corporate Account Managers (CAMs): Define the SOW at the organization level
• Sales Representatives (Reps): Create and manage service plans at the customer account level
• District Managers (DMs): Create and manage service plans at the customer account level
• OPS Admins: For hygiene accounts, they create service plans and templates due to lack of asset-level data 
Downstream Systems/Integration
• CRM: Hosts the app and stores service plans and schedules
• Asset Harvester: Supplies asset data (currently missing for hygiene)
• Ecolab 3D: Receives service reports generated from plans
• PDF Export: Allows sharing of service plans with customers, though not integrated into contracts 
Impact Considerations
 

 *  Account Type: 

 *  Water: Uses asset-level templates 
 *  Hygiene: Uses site-level templates due to missing asset data 
 

 *  Ship-To vs Site: 

 *  Field Services: Tie services to Ship-To 
 *  Sales/District Teams: Tie services to Site 
 *  Standalone (Street) Accounts: Follow similar process but without parent org account linkage 
 

 

Business Process Flow 

 *  CAM defines SOW using Enterprise Scope Builder 
 *  Service Templates are created for asset types or sites 
 *  Sales Rep/DM launches Service Plan Builder from CRM account 
 *  Plan is created with selected services and frequencies 
 *  Schedules and service records are auto-generated in CRM 
 *  Validation and activation of the plan triggers service visits 
 *  PDF export allows sharing with customers 
 

Key Features
• Auto-population of site and contact data from CRM
• Customization of service frequency and scope
• Ability to add services beyond the template
• PDF export for customer communication. The PDF is NOT stored in CRM by default. Rather, the user selects a save location

876879,Requirement,,,,,Unified Service Template Support for Water & Hygiene in Enterprise Scope Builder,,,,"Business Context
Under the One Customer (1C) model, a customer (H5 account) can serve both Hygiene (F&B) and Water (Nalco Water) business segments. 
Today, Enterprise Scope Builder supports one service template per asset type per org account
 
In the 1C model, both Water and Hygiene sales skill accounts will share the same Org Account, So users must be able to configure both Water and Hygiene services without duplicating templates or managing multiple versions.
 

 *  A business and design decision has been made to: 
 *  Maintain a single template per asset type 
 *  Allow configuration of both sales skills within that template 
 *  Provide UI clarity so users know which sales skill they are configuring 
 *  Ensure clean filtering and UI cues, not complex UX or backend duplication 
 

 
Business Goal 
Enable users to configure and manage service templates for Water & Hygiene in a single unified template, while clearly distinguishing which services belong to which sales skill. 

 
Business Outcomes 

 *  Maintain “One Customer / One Template” operational simplicity 
 *  Avoid template duplication and ongoing maintenance complexity 
 *  Preserve existing UI flow with minimal user disruption 
 *  Provide clear visual controls and cues to avoid confusion 
 *  Future-proof for broader 1C adoption across orgs and service execution models 
 

 
High-Level Requirements 

 *  Users must be able to configure services for either or both sales skills (Water & Hygiene) 
 *  System must not create multiple templates for the same asset type under same org 
 *  Sales skill must be explicitly selected when configuring the template 
 *  Sales skill selection must control which services appear for configuration 
 *  Screens must display the selected sales skill context 
 *  Templates list must indicate the sales skill context (Hygiene / Water / Both) 
 *  If the asset type is applicable to only one sales skill, sales skill should be: 

 *  Automatically defaulted 
 *  Locked (no user choice) 
 

 *  If asset type is applicable to both skills, user should: 
 *  Default to Hygiene first 
 *  Be able to switch to Water 
 *  Complete configuration for each skill as needed 
 

 
User Experience Requirements 

 *  General Experience 

 *  Minimize change to existing workflow 
 *  Provide clear pop-ups and labels where sales skill selection is required 
 *  Ensure consistent sales skill indicator across all relevant screens 
 *  Reinforce clarity without adding multiple pages or duplicate templates 
 

 *  Key User Interaction Touchpoints 

 *  Launch Point 

 *  Access via Enterprise Scope Builder from Org account (current behavior remains) 
 

 *  Sales Skill Selection Pop-Up 

 *  Appears only when asset type supports both skills 
 *  Includes: 

 *  Org (locked) 
 *  Region (locked) 
 *  Asset Type (auto or selectable) 
 *  Sales Skill (default Hygiene; switchable if dual-skill asset) 
 

 

 *  Action buttons: Save & Continue / Cancel 
 *  Template Configuration Screens 

 *  Must show Sales Skill indicator 
 *  Applies to: 
 *  Initial configuration screen 
 *  Service type selection screen 
 *  Frequency selection screens 
 *  Review / Final confirmation screen 
 

 *  Template Gallery View 
 *  Each template entry must display a simple label: 

 *  “Hygiene” 
 *  “Water” 
 *  “Hygiene + Water” (if user configured both) 
 

 *  Do not expose internal fields; present user-friendly text only 
 

 

 
Functional Rules 

 *  One template record per asset type per org 
 *  When asset supports both sales skills: 

 *  Template initially stores Hygiene configuration 
 *  User may re-enter and choose Water to add services 
 *  Both sets of services live under the same template record 
 

 *  When User clicks Create template Asset type availability depends on: 

 *  The sales skill child accounts under that H5 org 
 

 *  When User clicks Create template Sales skill dropdown behavior : 

 *  If only Hygiene child account exists ? default = Hygiene, locked 
 *  If only Water child account exists ? default = Water, locked 
 *  If both exist ? default = Hygiene, user may select Water 
 

 

 
User Flow Overview 

 *  Flow A — Configure from Division Template 

 *  User selects an existing division template 
 *  If dual-skill asset: 

 *  Pop-up Displays: 

 *  Org (locked) 
 *  Region (locked) 
 *  Asset type (Locked based on User selection) 
 *  Sales skill (Defaulted to Hygiene and User can changes it to Water) 
 

 

 *  If Single-skill asset: 

 *  Pop-up doesn't get displayed and user is navigated to the Customize Template screen and Sales skill should be shown on that screen 
 

 *  User configures template 
 *  Sales skill label shown on all config screens 
 *  Template saved as one record 
 *  Customized Template gallery shows skill label 
 

 *  Flow B — Create Template from Scratch 

 *  User selects Create Template 
 *  Pop-up displays: 

 *  Org (locked) 
 *  Region (locked) 
 *  Asset type (filtered based on sales skill accounts) 
 *  Sales skill (Derived from Asset Type) 
 

 *  User configures template 
 *  Sales skill label shown throughout 
 *  Template created as single record 
 

 *  Flow C — Edit Existing Template 

 *  User selects template to modify 
 *  Pop-up shows prior sales skill context 
 *  User may switch to the other skill to add more services if the Asset Type is a Dual Sales Skill Asset Type 
 *  Template continues as unified record 
 

 

 
Non-Functional Requirements 

 *  Must not degrade current EC Builder performance 
 *  Must not change template save logic or backend entity structure 
 *  Must preserve CRUD behavior for templates 
 

 
Success Criteria 

 *  User can create/edit templates with clear sales skill context 
 *  System restricts template creation to one per asset type 
 *  Sales skill displays consistently across screens 
 *  Templates representing dual-skill assets show “Hygiene + Water” 
 *  No change to system behavior for single-skill orgs/assets 
 *  No duplicate templates created 
 *  No backward-compatibility impact on existing templates

876890,User Story,,,,,,Support Editing Existing Customized Templates with Sales Skill Context & Dual-Skill Configuration (1C),,,"As a user editing an existing customized service template,
I need the system to guide me appropriately when a template supports both Water and Hygiene,
 
so that I can update service templates for the correct Sales Skill without confusion or risk of updating the wrong configuration.
 

 
The system must:
 

 *  Preserve existing edit experience when a template belongs to a single Sales Skill (Water-only or Hygiene-only) 
 *  Prompt the user only when the template is shared across both Sales Skills 
 *  Display Sales Skill context clearly throughout the edit process 
 *  Continue supporting the unified template model (one template per asset type, not per Sales Skill) 
 

 

","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,Refine,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,1,"Business Acceptance Criteria: 

 *  Direct navigation when the template is single-skill 

 *  Given the user is on the Customized Templates screen in Enterprise Scope Builder 
 *  When the selected template is associated with only one Sales Skill (Water only or Hygiene only) 
 *  And the user selects Edit Template 
 *  Then the system must open the existing Customize Template screen directly 
 *  And no Sales Skill pop-up should appear 
 *  And the correct Sales Skill must be displayed as read-only context throughout the edit steps 
 

 *  Pop-up required only when template supports both Sales Skills 

 *  Given the user selects Edit Template for a template that applies to both Water and Hygiene 
 *  When the pop-up opens 
 *  Then the pop-up must display: 

 *  Organization Account (read-only) 
 *  Global Region (read-only) 
 *  Asset Type (read-only) 
 *  Sales Skill (editable dropdown) pre-defaulted to Hygiene 
 *  Buttons: Save & Continue / Cancel 
 

 *  And the user must be able to switch Sales Skill between Hygiene and Water 
 *  So that they can choose which Sales Skill layer they are editing 
 

 *  Asset Type locked during edit 

 *  Given the template already exists 
 *  When the Sales Skill pop-up is shown during edit 
 *  Then the Asset Type must be locked  
 *  So that the scope of the template is preserved and not altered during edit 
 

 *  Navigation after pop-up continues standard edit flow 

 *  Given the user selects Save & Continue on the pop-up 
 *  When the user enters the template edit screens 
 *  Then the edit experience should follow the existing Enterprise Scope Builder template modification flow 
 *  And Sales Skill must remain visible throughout the steps 
 

 *  Cancel behavior 

 *  Given the user selects Cancel on the pop-up 
 *  Then the edit flow must close 
 *  And no changes must be applied to the template 
 

 *  System maintains unified template model 

 *  Given the template supports both Water and Hygiene 
 *  When the user edits either configuration 
 *  Then the system must continue to maintain one unified template record 
 *  And not create duplicate templates by Sales Skill

876888,User Story,,,,,,Enhanced Unified Service Template Creation & Sales Skill Handling in Enterprise Scope Builder,,," 
As a user of the Enterprise Scope Builder, I need a unified experience for creating service templates—whether starting from a divisional template or from scratch—so that the correct asset type, sales skill, and country selections drive the template configuration, while ensuring that only one template exists per asset type and that shared Water/Hygiene asset types can be configured cleanly within the same workflow.

 

 
This user flow must support:
 

 *  Hygiene-only division templates 
 *  Water-only division templates 
 *  Division templates applicable to both Water & Hygiene (shared templates) 
 *  Create a new Service Template from Scratch 

 *  Selecting a Water Asset Type 
 *  Selecting a Hygiene Asset Type 
 *  Select an Asset Type that is common for both Hygiene and Water 
 

 

 

","Singh, Nikita",In QA,CodeReviewed; FBU R2 Release; FBU_QAPush_Dec_Major5,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.17.04,2,Moved out of state PO Approved,Business,12,"Business Acceptance Criteria: 
Please review the attached Visio and PPT to look at the indicative mockups before approving/building this user story 

 *  Starting from a Divisional Template 

 *  Given the user launches Enterprise Scope Builder from an Org Account 

 *  When the user selects Service Templates and chooses an existing divisional template 
 *  Then a full configuration screen must open showing Organization Account, Global Region, Asset Type, Sales Skill, and Country selection. 
 

 

 *  Asset Type and Sales Skill Rules 

 *  Given the configuration screen loads with a pre-selected asset type 

 *  When the asset type is Water-only 
 *  Then Sales Skill must default to Water and be locked. 
 

 *  Given the asset type is Hygiene-only 

 *  When the screen loads 
 *  Then Sales Skill must default to Hygiene and be locked. 
 

 *  Given the asset type is shared between Water and Hygiene 

 *  When the screen loads 
 *  Then Sales Skill must default to Hygiene and remain editable so the user may switch to Water. 
 

 

 *  Global Region Selection Behavior 

 *  Given that the Org Account has a Global Region, 

 *  When the configuration screen loads 
 *  Then the Global Region should be defaulted to the Org Account Global Region, and should be locked for editing 
 

 

 *  Country Selection Behavior  

 *  Given the Org Account has child accounts in multiple countries  

 *  When the configuration screen loads  
 *  Then all applicable countries belonging to the Global Region selected on the Configuration screen must appear with matching checkboxes, and countries must be auto-selected based on child account presence.  
  

 *  Given the country grid is shown  

 *  When the user checks or unchecks any country  
 *  Then the service types shown later must respect only the selected countries. 
 

 

 *  Creating a Template Using “Create Template” Button 

 *  Given the user clicks Create Template 

 *  When the configuration screen loads 
 *  Then Asset Type must be an editable dropdown filtered as follows: 

 *  Given the H5 has only Hygiene child accounts 
 *  Then only Hygiene asset types must appear. 
 *  Given the H5 has only Water child accounts 
 *  Then only Water asset types must appear. 
 *  Given the H5 has both Water and Hygiene child accounts 
 *  Then both Water, Hygiene, and shared asset types must appear. 
 

 

 *  Given the user selects an asset type 

 *  When the asset type is Water-only or Hygiene-only 
 *  Then Sales Skill must auto-populate accordingly and be locked. 
 

 *  Given the user selects a shared asset type 

 *  When the screen refreshes 
 *  Then Sales Skill must default to Hygiene and remain editable. 
 

 

 *  Select Services Screen 

 *  Given users proceed after the initial configuration 

 *  When the Select Services screen loads 
 *  Then the top header must show Organization Account, Global Region, Asset Type, and Sales Skill. 
 *  and all fields on this header should be locked for editing
 
 

 *  Given the asset type and selected countries determine service offerings 

 *  When the screen loads 
 *  Then only service types applicable to the selected asset type and selected countries must appear. 
 

 

 *  Service Template by Asset Screens 

 *  Given the user selected multiple service types 

 *  When the Service Template by Asset screens display 
 *  Then one screen must appear per service type, each showing the same header (Org Account, Region, Asset Type, Sales Skill). 
 

 *  Given the user sets service details 

 *  When they proceed through each screen 
 *  Then all selections must be saved until completion. 
 

 

 *  Dual-Path Flow for Shared Asset Types 

 *  Given the asset type supports both Water and Hygiene 

 *  When the user completes the final Hygiene configuration screen 
 *  Then an additional button must appear: “Continue for Water Sales Skill.” 
 

 

 *  Given the user chooses Continue for Water 

 *  When the next configuration flow begins 
 *  Then the same series of configuration screens must appear, but now for Water. 
 

 *  Given the user clicks Finish at the end of the Water flow 

 *  Then they must be returned to the Service Templates home screen. 
 

 

 *  Finishing Template Creation 

 *  Given the user completes configuration (Hygiene-only, Water-only, or both) 

 *  When the user finishes the workflow 
 *  Then the template must appear in the Customized Templates gallery. 
 

 *  Given the template shows in the gallery 

 *  When displayed 
 *  Then it must include a clear label such as “Hygiene,” “Water,” or “Water + Hygiene.” 
 

 

 *  One Template Rule 

 *  Given a template already exists for a given asset type 
 *  When a user attempts to create another template for the same asset type 
 *  Then the system must prevent creation and direct the user to the existing template instead. 
 

 *  Validate that the same flow is available while editing a customized template

I want Push Template Changes to apply only to accounts belonging to the selected Sales Skill (Hygiene or Water),
 
So that updates are applied correctly without impacting accounts from the other Sales Skill.
 

 
In the 1C model, a single Org Account (H5) may contain both Water and Hygiene customer accounts. Today, when a user updates a Service Template and selects Push Template Changes, the system applies updates to all linked child customer accounts and their active agreements.

 
To support 1C behavior, the system must only update agreements and downstream service records for the Sales Skill (Hygiene or Water) associated with the template being modified.
 
If a template supports both skills, the user’s selection during edit should determine which Sales Skill group receives updates.
 
No changes should apply to the other Sales Skill unless explicitly triggered by a separate user action.
 

 
This ensures template propagation is controlled, accurate, and aligned to the future unified customer model.

","Kore, Abhijeet Vijay",In QA,FBU R2 Release; FBU_QAPush_Jan_Major1; TechDocNotAdded,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.17.04,2,Moved out of state PO Approved,Business,8,"Business Acceptance Criteria: 
Before Approving/Developing this user story, please review the attached mockups and visios  

 *  Auto-creation only for Hygiene SOWs 

 *  Given a user activates a Scope of Work 

 *  When the SOW is associated with the Hygiene sales skill 
 *  Then the system must auto-create a Site Service Template. 
 *  Note: Follow the exiting logic of Template creation for F&B. For 1C accounts the flow should only trigger for only Hygiene SOW's. 
 

 *  Given a SOW is associated with Water 

 *  When it is activated 
 *  Then no site asset or service template should be auto-created. 
 

 

 *  Auto-created template opens in the Customize Template screen 

 *  Given a hygiene template is auto-created 

 *  When the user selects “Edit Template” 
 *  Then the system must open the Customize Template screen with the unified header containing: (All fields on this header should be locked for editing) 

 *  Organization Account (locked) 
 *  Global Region (Auto Populated from the H5 account and is locked) 
 *  Asset Type (locked – “Site”) 
 *  Sales Skill (defaulted to Hygiene) 
 *  Countries in scope (pre-selected based on linked child accounts, user-editable) 
 

 *  And Then the header must follow the updated layout to improve readability and provide additional space for service types. 
 

 

 *  Asset Type and Sales Skill Behavior 

 *  Given the auto-created template is for a Site asset (common to both sales skills) 

 *  Then Sales Skill must default to Hygiene and remain editable, allowing the user to switch to Water later. 
 

 *  Given an asset type is Water-only or Hygiene-only  

 *  Then Sales Skill must be locked to the corresponding value.  
 

 

 *  Country Selection Rules 

 *  Given the template is auto-created 

 *  Then the list of countries must automatically reflect the countries of child accounts under the H5 organization account. 
 *  When the user opens the template 
 *  Then country checkboxes must be pre-selected and remain editable. 
 

 

 *  Frequency Display Rules (New Requirement)  

 *  Given a service type has multiple possible frequencies (e.g., monthly & quarterly)  

 *  When the service type appears in the template  
 *  Then each frequency must be displayed on a separate line.  
 *  Example:  
 *  Service Type: Equipment Check  
 *  Frequencies: Monthly + Quarterly  
 *  Two lines must appear, one per frequency.  
  

 *  Given templates are auto-created from SOW  

 *  Then frequency lines must reflect the offerings selected in the SOW. 
 

 

 *  “Service Templates by Asset” screen – One screen per service type 

 *  Given the user clicks Next from the Customize Template screen 

 *  Then the system must open the Service Templates by Asset flow with: 
 *  One screen per Service Type 
 *  Each screen showing: 

 *  Asset Type 
 *  Service Type 
 *  Estimated Frequency (one line per frequency) 
 *  Country 
 *  Sales Skill 
 

 

 *  Given multiple offerings map to the same service type 

 *  Then the system must still show the correct “frequency lines” from the SOW. 
 

 

 *  User Selection of Frequencies 

 *  Given the template is auto-created 
 *  Then the user must be able to adjust or confirm frequency choices for each service type. 
 

 *  Water continuation option 

 *  Given the asset type is common between Hygiene and Water 

 *  When the user reaches the final screen 
 *  Then the system must show: 

 *  Finish (Hygiene completed) 
 *  Continue for Water Sales Skill (optional) 
 

 *  When the user clicks “Continue for Water Sales Skill” 
 *  Then the Water template must open with the same asset type and country selections, but fresh frequency selections. 
 

 

 *  Saving and returning to templates 

 *  Given the user clicks Finish 
 *  Then the completed template must be saved 
 *  And Then the user must return to the Service Templates screen 
 *  And Then the template must display in the grid with a clear Sales Skill label: 

 *  Hygiene 
 *  Water 
 *  Both Water & Hygiene 
 

 

 *  One template per asset type per organization 

 *  Given a template is created (manual or auto) 
 *  Then the system must maintain the rule: 
 *  One asset type template per org account, 
 *  even if both sales skills are configured.

Requirement 

Conduct regression testing to validate the stability, accuracy, and completeness of CRM service plan records generated through the Service Plan Builder Power App. This ensures that updates, schema changes, and OneCustomer integrations do not disrupt existing workflows or data integrity. 

Business Objective 

To ensure that service plan records created via the Power App remain functional and reliable across Water and Hygiene divisions by: 

 *  Verifying that service plans are correctly generated, stored, and linked in CRM. 
 *  Confirming that business rules, templates, and downstream integrations remain intact. 
 *  Supporting uninterrupted service delivery and reporting across merged and legacy accounts. 
 

Requirements In Scope 

 *  Regression testing of:

 *  Launch behavior of the Power App from CRM child account records. 
 *  Template logic for recurring services (asset-level for Water, site-level for Hygiene). 
 *  Service plan customization and validation workflows. 
 *  Creation of service visit records in CRM upon activation. 
 *  PDF export functionality for customer-facing documents. 
 

 
 *  Validation of:

 *  Site-level schema updates and hierarchy realignment. 
 *  Business rules tied to Ship-To and Sold-To fields. 
 *  Role-based access and visibility for CAMs, DMs, Reps, and OPS Admins. 
 *  Integration with Ecolab 3D and Asset Harvester. 
 

 
 

Technical Considerations & Configuration 

 *  CRM hosts the Power App and stores service plans and schedules. 
 *  Asset Harvester supplies asset data (currently missing for Hygiene). 
 *  Ecolab 3D receives service reports generated from service plans. 
 *  PDF export logic must be tested for formatting and completeness. 
 *  CRM automation flows and plug-ins must be validated for compatibility. 
 *  Regression test scenarios should include:

 *  Launching the app from CRM. 
 *  Selecting and customizing service templates. 
 *  Validating service plan creation and downstream record generation. 
 *  Testing business rules tied to Ship-To/Sold-To transitions. 
 *  Confirming correct provisioning of automation programs post-account merges. 
 

 
 

User Interface Configuration 

 *  Sales Reps and DMs launch the Power App from CRM account records. 
 *  CAMs define Scope of Work (SOW) records that guide service plan creation. 
 *  OPS Admins manage hygiene templates due to lack of asset-level data. 
 *  UI elements must be tested for responsiveness, accuracy, and usability. 
 *  Ensure dropdowns, buttons, and form logic behave consistently across divisions. 
 

Security & Data Governance 

 *  Role-based access must be validated for all personas. 
 *  Audit trails for service plan creation and updates must remain intact. 
 *  Data integrity checks for merged accounts and site-level schema changes. 
 *  Governance over template usage and asset data loading confirmed. 
 *  Ensure compliance with reporting and regulatory requirements tied to service plans. 
 


Context
 
Service Plans are generated by the Service Plan Builder Power App, which enables Sales Representatives (Reps) and District Managers (DMs) to define, schedule, and manage recurring service activities for customer accounts. It automates the creation of service records in CRM based on predefined templates or custom configurations, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort. The app supports both Water and Hygiene business units, though Hygiene currently operates at a site level due to missing asset data. 
Groups
Water & Hygiene 
Personas 

 *  Corporate Account Managers (CAMs): Define the Scope of Work (SOW) at the organization level. 
 *  Sales Representatives (Reps): Create and customize service plans at the customer account level. 
 *  District Managers (DMs): Create and customize service plans at the customer account level. 
 *  OPS Admins: For Hygiene accounts, they are responsible for creating service plans and templates due to lack of asset-level data. 
 

Downstream Systems / Integration 

 *  CRM: Hosts the app and stores service plans and schedules. 
 *  Asset Harvester: Supplies asset data (currently missing for Hygiene). 
 *  Ecolab 3D: Receives service reports generated from plans. 
 *  PDF Export: Allows sharing of service plans with customers, though not integrated into contracts. 
 

Impact Considerations 

 *  Account Type:

 *  Water: Uses asset-level templates. 
 *  Hygiene: Uses site-level templates due to missing asset data. 
 

 
 *  Ship-To vs Site:

 *  Field Services: Tie services to Ship-To. 
 *  Sales/District Teams: Tie services to Site. 
 

 
 *  Standalone (Street) Accounts: Follow similar process but without parent org account linkage. 
 

Business Process Flow 

 *  CAM defines SOW using the Enterprise Scope Builder. 
 *  Service Templates are created for asset types or sites. 
 *  Sales Rep/DM launches Service Plan Builder from the CRM account. 
 *  Plan is created with selected services and frequencies. 
 *  Schedules and service records are auto-generated in CRM. 
 *  Validation and activation of the plan triggers service visits. 
 *  PDF export allows sharing with customers. 
 

Key Features 

 *  Auto-population of site and contact data from CRM. 
 *  Customization of service frequency and scope. 
 *  Ability to add services beyond the template. 
 *  PDF export for customer communication.

849601,User Story,,,,,,"Regression Testing - Link a VAS to a TSR, Opportunity (Retain to Win), TVD program record-  Post Sales Skill Implementation",,,"As a user, post-Global business shift to Sales Skill, I shall have the ability to link a Value Added Services (VAS) supplemental service record to a TSR, Opportunity Retain to Win, TVD program, or Retain to Win record so that the business motivation behind the service is clearly documented.
 
 


Context
This applies to District Services. Value Added Services (VAS) are supplemental service records tied to customer accounts and Service Activities (Originating Service Activity), used to document and track technical services such as lab analysis, test kits, and other support activities. VAS records help link TSRs (Technical Service Requests) to business motivations like opportunities, TVD programs, or Retain to Win records. They are essential for reporting, billing, and service execution.

Business Process Flow  
VAS records can be created in four ways: 

 *  Manual Entry

 *  Sales Rep clicks “+ New Value Added Service” on the account screen. 
 *  Selects type and value from dropdowns filtered by global business. 
 

 
 *  Via TSR (Life Sciences only)

 *  TSR creation triggers automatic VAS record. 
 *  Motivation (Gain/Grow/Retain) determines mandatory fields (e.g., Opportunity or Retain to Win). 
 

 
 *  Via Service Activity

 *  Sales Rep checks a box during service activity closure. 
 *  Enters VAS type and value. 
 *  System links VAS to the originating service activity. 
 

 
 *  Bulk Upload (Food & Beverage only)

 *  Quarterly or monthly loads submitted via ticket to Client Care. 
 *  Prebuilt package imports VAS records for lab analysis and test kits.
Groups 
 

 
 

 *  Life Sciences Division: Has automated VAS creation linked to TSRs. 
 *  Food & Beverage Division: Uses bulk upload packages for VAS creation. 
 


 
Personas

 *  Sales Representatives: Primary creators of VAS records, either manually or through TSRs or service activities. 
 *  Account Team Members: Can also create VAS records if they have access to the account. 
 *  Field Service Technicians: May contribute to VAS creation via service activities (limited to district visits). 
 *  Client Care Team: Manages bulk upload imports via prebuilt packages.
Downstream Systems/Integration 
 *  CRM Dynamics: Hosts VAS records and links them to TSRs, opportunities, and service activities. 
 *  SAP/EBS: VAS data may influence billing arrangements and service order creation. 
 *  Reporting Systems: VAS records are used for performance tracking and customer insights. 
 

 

Impact Considerations

 *  VAS visibility and required fields are driven by global business and sales skill. 
 *  Future state will hide global business and surface sales skill instead.

  Scenario: Automatically create VAS record via TSR (Life Sciences only) 
    Given I create a TSR in the Life Sciences division 
    When the TSR is submitted 
    Then a VAS record should be automatically created 
    And the system should require linking to Opportunity or Retain to Win based on Gain/Grow/Retain motivation 

 
  Scenario: Create VAS record via Service Activity closure 
    Given I am closing a Service Activity 
    When I check the box to create a VAS record 
    And I enter the VAS type and value 
    Then the system should link the VAS record to the originating Service Activity 
    And allow linking to TSR, Opportunity, TVD Program, or Retain to Win record 

  Scenario: Bulk upload VAS records (Food & Beverage only) 
    Given I am part of the Client Care Team 
    When I submit a bulk upload package for lab analysis or test kits

Context
The Scope of Work (SOW) functionality in CRM enables Corporate Account Managers (CAMs) to define service expectations at the organizational account level. These expectations guide District Managers (DMs) and Sales Representatives (Reps) on what services to perform at customer sites. The SOW acts as a directional tool, outlining commitments such as frequency of visits, types of services, and reporting requirements. It supports both Water and Hygiene business units, with differences in asset-level versus site-level service definitions.
SOW Org accounts are a grouping which can span across districts. 
Downstream Systems / Integration 

 *  CRM: Central system for managing accounts, SOWs, and service plans. 
 *  Asset Harvester: Supplies asset data to CRM (currently missing for Hygiene). 
 *  Ecolab 3D: Receives service reports and sends them to selected recipients. 
 *  Dataverse: Shared tables used for team member and contact data. 
 *  PDF Export: Allows sharing of service plans with customers manually. 
 

Impact Considerations 

 *  Water Business: Services are tied to site values. No change required. 
 *  Field Services Team: Services are tied to ship-to values. R1 data conversion requirement. 
 *  Hygiene Business: Operates at site level only due to lack of asset data. No change required. 
 *  Standalone (Street) Accounts: No parent org account; SOW and service plans are created directly at the customer account level. 
 *  Documents (PDFs of SOWs) will need to be migrated as part of OneCustomer efforts. 
 

Groups
Water & Hygiene 
Personas 

 *  Corporate Account Managers (CAMs): Create and manage SOWs at the organization account level. Select features within the Enterprise Scope Builder Power App that are related to the SOW. 
 *  District Managers (DMs): Reference SOWs to build service plans and execute site-level services. 
 *  Sales Reps: Reference SOWs to build service plans and execute site-level services. Water reps set up the SOW & Service Plans. 
 *  OPS Admins: Particularly for Hygiene accounts, they manage SOW creation and service templates. 
 *  Field Services Team: Execute services based on recurring service records, separate from district team plans. 
 

Business Process Flow 

 *  Operations team creates the CRM Account record. 
 *  CAM initiates SOW creation via the Enterprise Scope Builder app on a CRM organization account record. 
 *  CAM enters SOW inputs:

 *  Name, start/end dates 
 *  Selected service commitments (e.g., business reviews, entry/exit meetings, weekly visits) 
 *  Comments for context 
 

 
 *  Service Plan Builder: Reps use this to create service plans based on SOW guidance. 
 *  Customization: Reps can adjust frequency or add services as needed. 
 *  CAM activates the SOW: Only one active SOW per time period is allowed.

 *  Validation and Activation: Final review and activation of service plans generate recurring service records. 
 *  CRM Asset Type Template records are auto-generated.

849573,Requirement,,,,,Enable Accurate Sales Skill-Based Account Selection During Lead Creation and Qualification,,,,"As part of the One Customer (1C) model, a single customer (sold-to) can have multiple accounts in CRM differentiated by Sales Skill (e.g., Water or Hygiene).
During Lead creation or qualification, users can associate a Lead with an existing customer account via the Existing Account lookup field.
 
However, the current lookup view only shows minimal information (Account Number, Account Type), making it difficult for users to determine which Sales Skill account to choose when multiple accounts exist for the same customer number.
 

 
This requirement introduces an enhancement to the Lead form to improve visibility and accuracy during Lead-to-Account association.
 

 
The updated behavior will:
 

 *  Automatically open the Advanced Search view when users click the Existing Account lookup. 
 *  Display key columns such as Account Number, Account Name, Sales Skill, ERP System, and Account Type. 
 *  Ensure that users can clearly identify and select the correct Sales Skill account before qualifying the Lead. 
 *  Apply consistent filtering logic for 1C (multi-skill) and non-1C (single-skill) districts. 
 

 
This change ensures Leads are always associated with the correct customer-level account and division (Water/Hygiene), maintaining data accuracy in downstream opportunities and sales processes. 

 
In-Scope: 

 *  Modify the Existing Account lookup behavior on the Lead form to open in Advanced Search mode. 
 *  Display additional columns (Sales Skill, ERP System, Account Type, etc.) in the lookup view. 
 *  Enable filtering based on the user’s district and associated business configuration. 
 *  Maintain current conversion and lead qualification logic. 
 

 
Out-of-Scope: 

 *  Any changes to Lead creation logic, Lead scoring, or auto-assignment processes. 
 *  No modifications to Opportunity or downstream Sales entity behaviors. 
 *  No relationship or linkage to organization (H5) accounts — this requirement applies only to customer-level accounts. 
 

 
Key Business Outcomes: 

 *  Improve accuracy when linking Leads to existing customer accounts. 
 *  Prevent incorrect association between Water and Hygiene accounts that share the same number. 
 *  Enhance usability and reduce rework during Lead qualification. 
 *  Maintain consistency across 1C and non-1C districts.

869415,User Story,,,,,,Enhance “Existing Account” Lookup on Lead to Open Advanced Search Showing Sales Skill for Accurate Account Selection,,,"As a CRM user creating or qualifying a Lead,
I want the Existing Account lookup on the Lead form to open directly in the Advanced Search view instead of the default two-column lookup,
 
so that I can view additional columns — especially the Sales Skill — and correctly select the appropriate account (Water or Hygiene) when multiple accounts exist with the same number under the same organization.
 

 
Context & Background 
In the current CRM implementation: 

 *  When users create a new Lead, they can set “Is this an existing account?” to Yes. 
 *  This makes the Existing Account lookup field visible, which allows users to search for existing Accounts. 
 *  The default lookup view only displays two columns — Account Number and Account Type (Organization/Customer/Prospect) — which makes it difficult to distinguish between Water and Hygiene accounts that share the same Account Number. 
 *  Users must manually click the “chevron” (arrow) to expand and see more details, or open the record to confirm — both are slow and error-prone. 
 

 
With the upcoming One Customer (1C) model, the same Sold-To number may exist twice — once for Water and once for Hygiene — under the same H5/Org structure. 
To reduce errors and improve usability, we will make the Existing Account lookup open the Advanced Find window by default.
 
The Advanced Find view will display key columns including Account Number, Organization, Sales Skill, Account Type, and ERP System, so that users can identify and select the correct account at a glance.
 

 
This change applies to both 1C and non-1C districts but has specific visibility and filtering behavior depending on the district configuration.

 *  Scenario 1: Opening the Existing Account lookup should show Advanced Search view by default 

 *  Given the user is on a Lead record and the field “Is this an existing account?” = “Yes” 
 *  When the user clicks on the Existing Account lookup icon (magnifying glass) and click on advance search 
 *  And expand the customer record, the ERP SALES SKILL should be visible after Owner column in the advance search. 
 *  Then the system should automatically open the Advanced Search lookup window (not the basic two-column lookup)  
 *  And the Advanced Search grid should display the Sales Skill Column for 1C districts.  
 

 *  Scenario 2: System must retain current behavior for other lead scenarios 

 *  Given the Lead is being created without linking to an existing account 
 *  When “Is this an existing account?” = “No” 
 *  Then the “Existing Account” lookup should remain hidden and the Lead creation flow should proceed unchanged.

The featurerepresents Field Service management capabilities across Hygiene and Water divisionsunder the One Customer CRM model. This feature enables the transition of Field Service operations from legacy NSAP integrations to EBS under the One Customer model. It encompasses data model updates, ERP field harmonization, and Service Order integration redesign to ensure that recurring Services, Service Visits, and mobile workflows seamlessly operate with EBS Work Centers, Order Types, and Activity Types.
 

 
The goal is to achieve parity and coexistence between NSAP and EBS Systems during the hybrid transition period while supporting the new Sold-To-based account hierarchy introduced under the 1C program.
 

 
Key aspects include:
 

 *  Introducing dual ERP support (NSAP + EBS) for all Field Service entities (Service Types, Work Centers, Service Orders, and Visits). 
 *  Filtering and visibility logic for Work Centers, Order Types, and Sync-to-SAP actions based on ERP System and Sold-To Account. 
 *  Updating CRM-to-EBS integration field mappings for service order creation, update, confirmation, and Post Goods Issue (PGI). 
 *  Aligning technician, team, and account records with the correct EBS Work Centers and ERP systems. 
 *  Ensuring end-to-end EBS field parity for service order lifecycle events — creation, confirmation, PGI — and supporting smooth data migration for open and recurring services.

Context and Background 

 *  The integration previously relied on an option set field for Work Center selection, which is being deprecated. 
 *  The new lookup field (NSAP Work Center) provides direct entity linkage and reduces data errors. 
 *  A similar lookup exists on the Team entity to support team-based assignments.

I want to update the existing scheduled job that identifies Field Service Visits lacking an SAP Service Order Number,
 
So that it processes only those visits whose Sold-To Account ERP System = NLC_SAP, and excludes any records belonging to EBS (ECL_EBS) accounts, ensuring the correct job runs against the appropriate SAP backend.
 

 
Context and Background 

 *  The existing job currently scans all Field Service Visits without an SAP Service Order Number and sends them to the NSAP Post Service Order Creation process. 
 *  With the introduction of EBS accounts, NSAP and EBS records must be processed by different jobs to prevent duplicate or invalid order creation. 
 *  Filtering by ERP System ensures data segregation and prevents EBS records from accidentally being pushed into NSAP integrations.

 *  Filter Job Execution 

 *  Given the service order creation  job runs for Field Service Visits. (Azure Function Job) 
 *  When the Sold-To Account ERP System = NLC_SAP, 
 *  Then the record is included in the job for NSAP service-order creation. 
 *  Modify the Existing filter condition of the job to add an additional filter on the ERP System = NLC_SAP

Service Type associate to the Service Visit is not A QUOTE REQUEST / SITE VISIT
 
Payment Type = PO, Billing Arrangement, No Charge
 
ZACT is not equal to '0000000' 
 
The field 'Disable SAP Sync' should be set as FALSE
 
 

 

 *  Exclude EBS Records 

 *  Given a Field Service Visit is linked to a sold to account with ERP System = ECL_EBS, 
 *  When the scheduled job executes, 
 *  Then the visit must be skipped and not sent to NSAP order integration.

871109,User Story,,,,,,Technical Spike: Data Mapping for EBS Service Order Integration,,,"Description: 
As an Integration Developer, I need to create comprehensive data mapping specifications for service order integration between Dynamics 365 CRM and EBS SAP systems, so that all field mappings, master data relationships, and transformation rules are clearly defined for implementation. 

 
Business Context: 
During the FBU 1C migration from NSAP to EBS, service orders must be created in the correct ERP system based on customer account hierarchies. This requires precise field mappings between CRM work orders and SAP service order structures, including master data relationships for Work Centers, Order Types, and Activity Types. Inaccurate mappings could result in failed service order creation, incorrect cost allocation, or billing errors. 

 
Scope: 

 *  Field mapping between CRM and EBS SAP structures 
 *  Master data mapping (Work Centers, Order Types, Activity Types, GL accounts) 
 *  Data transformation and validation rules 
 *  Business rules for mapping logic 
 *  Stakeholder validation and documentation

I want to enhance the existing option sets for SAP Division and SAP Distribution Channel on the Account entity,
 
So that the system can support new EBS-specific values required for Field Service, Service Order, and integration processes.
 

 
Context and Background 

 *  Currently, both fields — SAP Division and SAP Distribution Channel — are implemented as option sets that are aligned with NSAP. 
 *  Existing SAP Division values include: 

 *  01 - Chemical and Reference, 02 - Service, 03 - Equipment, 04 - Cosmetics, 05 - Alternate, 06 - Colloidal, CT - Colloidal, FT - Finishing, PC - PERF.Cosmet, WP - Water Purity. 
 

 *  Existing SAP Distribution Channel values include: 

 *  01 - Standard and Reference, 02 - Internet, 03 - Reseller, 04 - Alternate Channel. 
 

 *  These option sets are currently synced with NSAP’s configuration and are used by downstream processes such as order type filtering, division-based logic, and SAP integration mapping. 
 *  With the introduction of EBS, new EBS-specific divisions and distribution channels need to be confirmed and added. 
 *  This ensures that EBS accounts can have correct attributes assigned for seamless integration with EBS order creation, billing, and service processing. 
 

 

","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,Duplicate; Refine,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Enhance Division Option Set 

 *  Given that EBS-specific SAP Division values have been confirmed by the business, 
 *  When the CRM administrator updates the SAP Division option set, 
 *  Then all newly provided EBS divisions must be added without removing any of the existing NSAP values. 
 

 *  Enhance Distribution Channel Option Set 

 *  Given that EBS-specific SAP Distribution Channel values have been confirmed by the business, 
 *  When the CRM administrator updates the SAP Distribution Channel option set, 
 *  Then all EBS-specific values must be added in addition to the existing NSAP options.

 *  A new job must mirror the existing logic but target the EBS service-order creation endpoint. 
 *  The EBS job will use EBS-specific fields such as EBS WorkCenter and EBS Order Type.

868929,User Story,,,,,,Filter SAP Order Type Option Set on Recurring Service Form Based on Payment Method and Sold-To Account ERP System,,,"As a Field Service Administrator
I want the SAP Order Type option-set values on the Field Service Recurring Service form to be filtered dynamically based on both the selected Payment Method and the ERP System of the linked Sold-To Account,
 
So that only valid order types are displayed for each combination of payment method and ERP system, avoiding downstream integration or billing errors in SAP / EBS.
 

 
Context and Background: 

 *  The SAP Order Type field on the Recurring Service form is an option set whose values are currently filtered only by Payment Method. 
 *  With the introduction of the One Customer (1C) model and EBS integration, the filtering must also consider the ERP System value (NLC_SAP or ECL_EBS) on the linked Sold-To Account. 
 *  The goal is to ensure that when a Sold-To Account belongs to EBS (ECL_EBS), only EBS-compatible order types are displayed and legacy NSAP (NLC_SAP) values are hidden.

869718,Requirement,,,,,Enable Dual-ERP Work Center Structure for NSAP and EBS Systems Across Field Service Entities,,,,"Background and Business Context

 *  As part of the One Customer (1C) initiative, both NSAP and EBS systems will coexist during the transition period for Water and Hygiene accounts. 
 *  The existing CRM configuration supports only NSAP Work Centers, used for service order creation, synchronization, and routing in integration with NSAP. 
 *  To support EBS integration and alignment with the new ERP data model, CRM must accommodate both NSAP and EBS Work Centers concurrently. 
 *  This enhancement ensures that all relevant Field Service entities (User, Team, Recurring Service, Service Visit) can dynamically reference the correct Work Center based on the Sold-To account’s ERP system. 
 

 
Scope of Work 

 *  The following functional and data changes are required to enable dual-ERP WorkCenter support: 
 *  Extend SAP WorkCenter Entity 
 *  Add a new lookup field called ERP System on the SAP WorkCenter table. 
 *  This lookup will identify whether the WorkCenter belongs to NSAP (NLC_SAP) or EBS (ECL_EBS). 
 *  Update all existing WorkCenter records to set the ERP System = NLC_SAP. 
 *  Once EBS WorkCenters are provided by business, create new WorkCenter records with ERP System = ECL_EBS. 
 *  Ensure fields such as SAP Call Center, SAP Planner Group, SAP Main Plant, SAP Work Center Surcharge, SAP Work Center Fee Admin are populated for the new Work Centers. 
 

 
Update User Entity 

 *  Rename the existing field SAP Work Center to NSAP SAP Work Center. 
 *  Add a new lookup field EBS SAP Work Center on the User table. 
 *  Users can now have mappings for both NSAP and EBS Work Centers, depending on the ERP they operate under. 
 *  Perform a data update to associate each user with both Work Centers using the business-provided mapping. 
 

 
Update Team Entity 

 *  Rename existing SAP Work Center field to NSAP SAP Work Center. 
 *  Add a new lookup field EBS SAP Work Center to the Team table. 
 *  Each team record should have both NSAP and EBS Work Centers populated based on business mapping. 
 *  Update all active Team records accordingly. 
 

 

 
Field Service Data Alignment 

 *  Update Field Service Recurring Service and Field Service Service Visit records to reference the appropriate Work Center based on the Sold-To account’s ERP system. 
 *  For active (non-completed, non-cancelled) records: 

 *  If Sold-To ERP = NSAP ? link NSAP WorkCenter. 
 *  If Sold-To ERP = EBS ? link mapped EBS WorkCenter. 
 

 *  No updates should be applied to completed or cancelled records. 
 

 
Master Data Setup 

 *  Once business mapping is provided, all new EBS Work Centers must be created in CRM with valid values for Call Center, Planner Group, Main Plant, and other related fields. 
 *  Data cleanup must ensure there are no orphaned or duplicate WorkCenter records. 
 *  The EBS WorkCenters should mirror NSAP hierarchy and functional structure where applicable. 
 

 
Expected Outcome 

 *  CRM supports both NSAP and EBS Work Centers concurrently.

868920,User Story,,,,,,Rename SAP Work Center Field to NSAP SAP Work Center and Add EBS SAP Work Center Field on Team Entity,,,"As a System Administrator
I want to rename the existing “SAP Work Center” field to “NSAP SAP Work Center” and add a new lookup field “EBS SAP Work Center” on the Team entity
 
So that each team can be associated with both NSAP and EBS Work Centers, ensuring the correct Work Center details are aligned to Field Service recurring services and Field Service visits depending on the Sold-To account’s ERP system.
 

 
Context and Background: 

 *  Currently, the Team entity in CRM has a single lookup field called SAP Work Center, which links to NSAP-specific Work Centers only. 
 *  With the introduction of EBS as a parallel ERP system under the One Customer (1C) model, Field Service teams must be able to align with Work Centers from both systems. 
 *  The Work Center association at the Team level determines which Work Center details are referenced when creating or updating Field Service Recurring Services and Service Visits. 
 *  Therefore, the Team entity must: 

 *  Retain existing NSAP alignment. 
 *  Gain a new lookup to EBS Work Centers. 
 *  Support both references concurrently so routing and integration logic can dynamically identify the right Work Center during ERP interactions.

 *  Field Rename 

 *  Given that the Team entity currently contains a field named “SAP Work Center,” 
 *  When the enhancement is implemented, 
 *  Then this field should be renamed to “NSAP SAP Work Center.” 
 *  And this Field should be automatically filtered  to only show the Work Centers that have an ERP system of NLC_SAP 
 

 *  New Lookup Field Creation 

 *  Given that EBS Work Centers must be supported, 
 *  When the enhancement is deployed, 
 *  Then a new lookup field called “EBS SAP Work Center” should be added to the Team entity referencing the SAP Work Center table. 
 *  And this Field should be automatically filtered  to only show the Work Centers that have an ERP system of ECL_EBS
 
 

 *  Data Entry and Validation 

 *  Given that both Work Center fields are now available on the Team record, 

 *  When a system administrator opens a Team record, 
 *  Then they should be able to assign both an NSAP SAP Work Center and an EBS SAP Work Center to that team. 
 

 *  Given that Field Service entities use Team associations for routing,  

 *  When a recurring service or service visit is created or updated,  
 *  Then the system should automatically reference the correct Work Center (EBS or NSAP) based on the Sold-To account’s ERP system.  
 

 

 *  Field Visibility and Security  

 *  Given that standard users should not edit ERP configuration data,  
 *  When a non-admin user opens a Team record,  
 *  Then both Work Center fields should be visible but read-only.  
 

 *  Filtering and Reporting  

 *  Given that business users may need to review which teams are aligned with which Work Centers,  
 *  When an advanced find, list view, or report is executed,  
 *  Then both NSAP SAP Work Center and EBS SAP Work Center fields should be available as searchable and filterable columns.

I want to Hide the existing “SAP Work Center” field and add a new lookup “NSAP SAP Work Center” and add a new lookup field “EBS SAP Work Center” on the User entity
 
So that each user can be associated with both NSAP and EBS Work Centers, ensuring the system can determine the correct Work Center details to send to the appropriate ERP (NSAP or EBS) during service order creation, update, or confirmation.
 

 
Context and Background: 

 *  Currently, the User entity contains only one field — SAP Work Center — which links users to NSAP-specific Work Centers. 
 *  As part of the One Customer (1C) initiative and dual-ERP enablement, both NSAP and EBS Work Centers must be supported. 
 *  When a field service order is created, updated, or confirmed, the integration logic must determine which ERP to send data to (NSAP or EBS) based on the Sold-To account’s ERP system. 
 *  To enable this flexibility, the User record must hold references to both ERP-specific Work Centers. 
 *  This story covers: 
 *  Renaming the existing SAP Work Center field to NSAP SAP Work Center. 
 *  Adding a new lookup field called EBS SAP Work Center to link users with their EBS-specific Work Center. 
 *  Ensuring that these lookups integrate seamlessly with downstream logic for service order creation and updates.

 *  Field Create 

 *  Given that the User entity currently has a field named “SAP Work Center,” 
 *  When the update is implemented, 
 *  Then this field should be Hidden  
 *  and a new lookup field named “NSAP SAP Work Center."" should be added referencing the SAP work Center table 
 *  And this Field should be automatically filtered  to only show the Work Centers that have an ERP system of NLC_SAP
 
 

 *  New Lookup Field Creation 

 *  Given that EBS integration requires a separate Work Center reference, 
 *  When the enhancement is deployed, 
 *  Then a new lookup field named “EBS SAP Work Center” should be added to the User entity. 
 *  And this Field should be automatically filtered  to only show the Work Centers that have an ERP system of ECL_EBS
 
 

 *  Data Entry and Validation  

 *  Given that both NSAP and EBS Work Centers are now available on the User form,  

 *  When a system admin opens a User record,  
 *  Then they should be able to assign both NSAP and EBS Work Centers to the same user record.  
 

 *  Given that the ERP system of a Sold-To account determines which Work Center is relevant,  

 *  When integration logic runs during service order creation, update, or confirmation,  
 *  Then the system should automatically use the appropriate Work Center (EBS or NSAP) based on the account’s ERP system and the user aligned to the service visit.  
 

 

 *  Field Visibility and Security 

 *  Given that an Ops Admin/Ops Admin Lead opens the User record, 
 *  Then both Work Center fields (NSAP and EBS) should be visible editable. 
 

 *  Reporting and Filtering  

 *  Given that the business may need to report which users belong to which Work Centers,  
 *  When an Advanced Find or view is created,  
 *  Then both NSAP SAP Work Center and EBS SAP Work Center should be available as searchable and filterable columns.

I want to update all existing SAP Work Center records in CRM with the ERP System value “NLC_SAP” and create new EBS Work Center records with ERP System value “ECL_EBS” along with all required attributes
 
So that both NSAP and EBS Work Centers are correctly established in CRM for dual-ERP operation and can be used reliably during service order creation, update, and confirmation.
 

 
Context and Background: 

 *  Currently, CRM includes only NSAP Work Centers, used for service order creation and integration with NSAP. 
 *  Under the One Customer (1C) model, equivalent EBS Work Centers must be introduced. 
 *  A new lookup field ERP System has been added to the Work Center entity to differentiate NSAP vs. EBS records.

 *  Create New EBS Work Centers 

 *  Given that business has provided a mapping of EBS-equivalent Work Centers, 
 *  When new Work Centers are created in CRM, 
 *  Then each record must be created with ERP System = ECL_EBS. 
 

 *  Attribute Setup for New EBS Work Centers 

 *  Given that EBS Work Centers must be fully defined for downstream integration, 
 *  When the new EBS Work Centers are created, 
 *  Then each record must include the following attributes populated: 

 *  Name 
 *  SAP Cost Center

 *  The business will provide a mapping file defining one-to-one relationships between existing NSAP Work Centers and corresponding EBS Work Centers, including all required reference attributes.

I want to add an ERP System lookup field on the SAP Work Center entity
 
So that each Work Center record can be explicitly associated with its corresponding ERP system (NSAP or EBS), ensuring proper segregation, reporting, and integration alignment across dual-ERP operations.
 

 
Context and Background: 

 *  Currently, the CRM SAP Work Center entity contains only NSAP Work Centers. 
 *  There is no existing way to differentiate which ERP system a given Work Center record belongs to. 
 *  As part of the One Customer (1C) initiative, both NSAP and EBS Work Centers will coexist. 
 *  EBS Work Centers will be introduced and maintained in CRM, and integration logic must determine which Work Center to use based on the Sold-To account’s ERP system. 
 *  Therefore, an ERP System lookup field must be introduced on the SAP Work Center entity to distinguish between the two ERP sources and enable filtering, reporting, and integration logic. 
 *  This field will reference the ERP System master entity (values such as NLC_SAP for NSAP and ECL_EBS for EBS).

 *  Field Creation 

 *  Given that the SAP Work Center entity currently has no way to identify ERP system association, 
 *  When the enhancement is implemented, 
 *  Then a new mandatory lookup field named ERP System should be added on the SAP Work Center entity referencing the ERP System table after the field Name. 
 *  Existing Users with Edit Access to SAP Work Center should be able to update the ERP system field 
 

 *  New Data Entry  

 *  Given that new Work Centers will be created in CRM in the future,  
 *  When a new Work Center record is created,  
 *  Then the user should be required to select an ERP System (either NLC_SAP or ECL_EBS) before saving the record.  
 

 *  Data Validation  

 *  Given the ERP System field is now available,  

 *  When any Work Center record is opened in the form,  
 *  Then the ERP System field should be visible and editable for administrators and read-only for standard users.  
 

 *  Given that data integrity must be maintained,  

 *  When the ERP System lookup is updated,  
 *  Then the change should be tracked in audit history to ensure visibility of updates.  
 

 

 *  Reporting  

 *  Given that business users may require reports separating NSAP and EBS Work Centers,  
 *  When Work Center views or advanced finds are run,  
 *  Then the ERP System field should be available as a searchable and filterable column to distinguish the data sets.

869717,Requirement,,,,,Enable Dual-ERP Support on Service Type Entity (NSAP & EBS Fields and Views),,,,"Background and Business Context
 

 *  As part of the One Customer (1C) initiative, Field Service entities need to support both NSAP and EBS attributes simultaneously. 
 *  The Service Type table in CRM currently contains SAP-specific references (e.g., PM Activity Type and ZACT codes) used only for NSAP integration. 
 *  Since EBS uses its own distinct set of activity and order mappings, the system must be able to differentiate between NSAP and EBS fields while maintaining compatibility with existing records and integrations. 
 *  This requirement ensures dual ERP capability for configuration, reporting, and integration purposes during and after the transition to EBS. 
 

 
Scope of Change 

 *  Rename existing field “SAP PM Activity Type” to “NSAP SAP PM Activity Type.” 
 *  Add a new field “EBS SAP PM Activity Type” with a new option set containing all valid EBS activity type values. 
 *  Rename existing field “ZACT” to “NSAP ZACT.” 
 *  Add a new field “EBS ZACT” with a new option set containing all valid EBS ZACT values. 
 *  Ensure both NSAP and EBS fields are available on the Service Type form and views for configuration and reference. 
 

 
Field Configuration Details 

 *  Retain all existing NSAP PM Activity Type option values as they are: 
 *  Not Applicable, REN, ZAN, ZCL, ZCO, ZEQ, ZES, ZCD, ZIN, ZMI, ZOA, ZPM, ZRE, ZSA, ZSS, ZSEO, ZTR, ZWA, ZPT. 
 *  Configure the new EBS SAP PM Activity Type option set with values sourced from the final EBS mapping document. 
 *  Configure the new EBS ZACT option set similarly using EBS-approved values. 
 

 
Form and View Updates 

 *  Update the Active Incident Type view to rename the existing ZACT column to NSAP ZACT and add the new EBS ZACT column. 
 *  Update the Allow on Service Type lookup to display both NSAP ZACT and EBS ZACT. 
 *  Update the Allow on Service Visit lookup to display both NSAP ZACT and EBS ZACT. 
 *  Update the Recurring Service Type view to rename ZACT to NSAP ZACT and add EBS ZACT. 
 *  The Inactive Incident Type view does not require any changes. 
 *  Ensure all relevant forms show both NSAP and EBS PM Activity Type fields in logical grouping for usability. 
 

 
Data Update and Cleanup Activities 

 *  Populate the new EBS fields (EBS SAP PM Activity Type and EBS ZACT) for all existing service types once created. 
 *  Validate that every service type record has both NSAP and EBS mappings where applicable. 
 *  Coordinate with the integration team to confirm the final value mappings for EBS fields. 
 *  Conduct a data quality check to ensure no records are left unmapped or inconsistent. 
 

 
Dependencies and Preconditions 

 *  Requires confirmation of EBS activity and ZACT code values from the integration mapping team. 
 *  Dependent on completion of dual-ERP design decisions for Work Center and Order Type features. 
 *  Must be completed before EBS service order creation and synchronization development begins. 
 

 
Expected Outcome 

 *  Service Type entity supports both NSAP and EBS fields simultaneously. 
 *  All active views and forms are updated to reflect both sets of fields. 
 *  Integration logic can dynamically determine which fields to use based on the account’s ERP system. 
 *  Data consistency and mapping completeness are validated across all existing service types.

868931,User Story,,,,,,Update Service Type Entity with NSAP and EBS Fields (SAP PM Activity Type and ZACT) including Form and View Updates,,,"As a CRM System Administrator
 
 
I want the Service Type entity in Field Service to support both NSAP and EBS fields for ZACT
 
So that the system can operate in a dual-ERP environment and correctly handle both NSAP and EBS integration requirements without disrupting existing processes.
 

 
Context and Background: 

 *  Currently, the Service Type entity in CRM contains two SAP-related fields — “SAP PM Activity Type” and “ZACT.” 
 *  This field is used exclusively for NSAP integrations and are referenced in multiple views, lookups, and forms across the Field Service module. 
 *  As part of the One Customer initiative and EBS migration, the system must now maintain separate field sets for NSAP and EBS to support hybrid operations. 
 *  This requires renaming the existing NSAP fields, introducing new EBS fields, and updating all related views and forms to display and manage both sets consistently. 
 *  These changes ensure integration, reporting, and configuration compatibility across both ERP systems during the transition period. 
 

 
Scope of the Change: 

 *  Rename existing field “SAP PM Activity Type” to “NSAP SAP PM Activity Type.”  
 *  Add a new field “EBS SAP PM Activity Type” (Option Set) to store EBS-specific values.  
 *  Rename existing field “ZACT” to “NSAP ZACT.” 
 *  Add a new field “EBS SER” (Text) to store EBS-specific SER codes. 
 *  Update Service Type forms, lookups, and system views to display both NSAP and EBS fields. 
 *  Ensure both NSAP and EBS fields are editable and visible to admins for configuration. 
 *  Retain all existing NSAP data and logic while enabling new EBS data capture.

 *  Field Updates 

 *  Given the existing Service Type entity in CRM contains the fields “SAP PM Activity Type” and “ZACT,”  

 *  When the solution is deployed,  
 *  Then the “SAP PM Activity Type” field should be renamed to “NSAP SAP PM Activity Type,” retaining all its existing values.  
 

 *  Given the renamed NSAP field exists,  

 *  When the EBS migration design is implemented,  
 *  Then a new field named “EBS SAP PM Activity Type” should be added with a separate option set containing valid EBS PM Activity Type values.  
 

 *  Given the existing “ZACT” field is used for NSAP integrations, 

 *  When the entity updates are deployed, 
 *  Then it should be renamed to “NSAP ZACT” and a new “EBS SER” field should be created as an text field for EBS-specific codes. 
 *  EBS SER field should be mandatory 
 

 

 *  Form Updates 

 *  Given the Service Type main form displays NSAP fields,  

 *  When the update is deployed,  
 *  Then the form should also display both NSAP SAP PM Activity Type and EBS SAP PM Activity Type field on the form.  
 

 *  Given the form previously displayed the ZACT field, 

 *  When the update is deployed, 
 *  Then both “NSAP ZACT” and “EBS SER” fields should appear on the form 
 

 

 *  View Updates 
 *  Given system views exist such as “Active Incident Type,” “Allow on Service Lookup,” “Allow on Service Visit Lookup” and “Recurring Service Type,” 

 *  When the solution is deployed, 
 *  Then each of these views should display both “NSAP ZACT” and “EBS SER” columns. 
 

 

 *  Data Validation 

 *  Given existing Service Type records contain NSAP values only, 

 *  When the new EBS fields are introduced, 
 *  Then the EBS fields should initially be blank until updated with the appropriate values. 
 

 
 *  Given EBS field values are entered, 

 *  When the record is saved, 
 *  Then both NSAP and EBS values should persist correctly and appear in their respective views.

Context and Background: 

 *  Following the introduction of new field (EBS SAP PM Activity Type and EBS ZACT) on the Service Type entity, all existing service types need valid EBS values to ensure end-to-end integration readiness. 
 *  This activity represents a master data setup or data conversion task that ensures all Service Type records are populated with their corresponding EBS values before enabling EBS service order creation, synchronization, or testing. 
 *  The EBS mappings for PM Activity Type and NSAP ZACT and EBS SER will be derived from the finalized mapping documents shared by the integration team.

As a sales rep, when I initiate an EQR for a  new project, then I start from an opportunity so that I follow a unified  process across divisions. 
  

 

 

  

  
As a sales rep, when I need a budget/equipment  fund quote, then I can create an EQR directly from the account so that I  avoid unnecessary pipeline visibility. 
  

 

 

  

  
As an engineering manager, when an EQR is  submitted, then I see all relevant documents and project details so that I  can assign the right engineer efficiently. 
  

 

 

  

  
As a system admin, when accounts are migrated  to one customer, then I see sales skill on each account so that I can  distinguish Water and Hygiene for routing. 
  

 

 

  

  
As a user, when I upload documents for an EQR,  then I use the designated document section so that engineering has all  required information in one place.

836344,Feature,,,,CRM: Analytical Sampling App (ASA) –  Regression Testing Only,,,,,"This feature ensures that the Analytical Sampling App (ASA) continues to function seamlessly under the new One Customer data model, where Ship-To records are retained for both NSAP and EBS accounts. The previous plan to remove Ship-To references and refactor the app for Sold-To-based logic is no longer applicable.

 
The feature now focuses on confirming end-to-end stability of ASA with the current CRM–EBS data structure and implementing integration updates for EBS billing arrangements.
 

 
Scope and Objectives 

 *  Regression Validation: 

 *  Confirm that ASA continues to operate without functional or data integrity issues when Ship-To records are fully loaded from both EBS and NSAP sources. 
 *  Validate that all existing workflows—sample creation, billing selection, and LIMS integrations—function as designed with no behavioral deviations. 
 

 *  Billing Arrangements Integration: 

 *  Deactivate all legacy NSAP billing arrangements in CRM so they are no longer selectable in ASA. 
 *  Introduce new integration pulling billing arrangements from EBS via Snowflake, mapping them correctly to Ship-To and Sold-To accounts. 
 *  Ensure no artificial modification of NSAP arrangement end dates; retain their historical values. 
 *  Handle interim billing via district or PO billing if EBS billing arrangements are not yet available at runtime. 
 

 *  LIMS Integration: 

 *  Maintain existing LIMS linkage through Ship-To-based CDM keys. No refactor is needed since Ship-To data remains present. 
 *  UI and Functionality: 
 *  No UI redesign required for ASA. 
 *  Maintain the same experience and logic for all ASA users across business lines. 
 

 

 
Technical Deliverables 

 *  Snowflake Technical Spike: 

 *  Review Snowflake views to confirm data structures for EBS billing arrangements. 
 *  Validate mapping logic from Snowflake to CRM billing arrangement tables. 
 *  Propose view enhancements if additional attributes (e.g., effective dates, account keys) are required. 
 

 *  Integration Development: 

 *  Build or update integration pipelines for EBS billing arrangements and allocations. 
 *  Validate synchronization between CRM, Snowflake, and ASA modules. 
 

 *  Data Conversion Task: 

 *  Deactivate NSAP billing arrangements tied to impacted accounts for R1 and R2 accounts. 
 *  Ensure historical data remains accessible in read-only mode for audit. 
 

 *  Regression Testing: 

 *  Test ASA across Water and F&B divisions to verify continued compatibility with Ship-To and Sold-To associations. 
 *  Include LIMS sync, sample creation, and billing workflow validation in test scope. 
 

 

 
Out of Scope 

 *  No ASA UI refactoring. 
 *  No rework of LIMS integration or CDM key logic. 
 *  No functional change to sampling workflows or calculation logic. 
 

 
Dependencies 

 *  Snowflake view readiness for EBS billing data. 
 *  EBS-to-CRM data flow activation. 
 *  Data conversion completion for NSAP billing arrangement deactivation. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Expected Outcome
 

 

 
ASA remains functionally stable and aligned with the unified One Customer data model. EBS billing arrangements are integrated seamlessly, ensuring accurate billing linkage while legacy NSAP arrangements are cleanly deactivated without impacting user experience.

834306,Feature,,,,Integration: Update CRM-CDM User Enablement Logic for One Customer Account Model,,,,,"This feature addresses necessary updates to the user enablement integration between CRM and CDM as Ecolab transitions to the One Customer model, where both Nalco Water and Hygiene business units will share Base Customer Accounts (BCAs).

 
Key Business Context: 

 *  Today, when a CRM user clicks “Enable for Digital Tools”, the system checks if the account’s email domain is approved and if the site is eligible for E3D. 
 *  If criteria are met, CRM triggers a webhook to CDM to create a user and assign roles aligned to a Sold-To account. 
 *  This process currently works for Nalco Water accounts only and assumes that each account number is unique. 
 

 
What is Changing: 

 *  After One Customer go-live, Water and Hygiene accounts may share the same account number, causing the current logic (which assumes account number uniqueness) to break or create duplicate records. 
 *  The integration must be updated to loop through and process multiple CRM accounts that share the same number, ensuring correct user role and site alignment in CDM. 
 *  The same enablement flow will be extended to Hygiene, requiring support for new division-based filters during alignment creation. 
 

 
Expected Enhancements: 

 *  Fix the contact/user alignment logic in CRM to properly handle multiple matching accounts after account merge. 
 *  Ensure alignment and role creation continues to work correctly even when duplicate account numbers exist (e.g., one for Water and one for Hygiene). 
 *  Begin supporting Hygiene accounts in the user enablement flow using the same webhook-triggered logic used today for Nalco Water. 
 

 
This feature ensures that the user setup and digital tool enablement process continues to work correctly after the account merge and prepares the system for enabling Hygiene users in CDM.

834318,Feature,,,,Integration: MAP 2.0 to CRM Alignment Sync,,,,,"Implement integration to consume alignment and account ownership data from MAP 2.0 into CRM using Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines. MAP 2.0 reads harmonized customer and user-role alignment data from Snowflake views (which are populated via ERP sources like EBS/NSAP) and publishes that data into CRM. This includes:
 

 *  Account-to-user alignment (e.g., SAM assignments, BDM/DM role alignments) 
 *  District Alignments 
 *  Sales Skill ownership by base customer and sold-to 
 *  Territory and hierarchy mapping logic for F&B and Nalco Water 
 *  Support for future extensions to include CAM/AVP roles if needed 
 

 
This integration enables CRM to serve as the downstream system for alignment logic already validated and published by MAP, reducing duplication and manual maintenance. The integration must be built to handle: 

 *  Scheduled ADF jobs pulling alignment data from MAP 2.0 Snowflake views 
 *  Field mapping and validation to ensure CRM record updates reflect MAP hierarchy 
 *  Merging logic for sold-to and base customer records 
 *  Role-based assignment via CRM access teams or other role modeling 
 

 
Regression testing is required to validate: 

 *  Alignments remain stable through BCA migration and CDM site merge scenarios 
 *  No duplicate alignments or conflicting ownerships occur 
 *  Existing manual assignments are not overwritten unintentionally

834692,Requirement,,,,,45. CRM Field Mapping Validation Against MAP Views,,,,"Business Capability overview:  
The integration between MAP 2.0 and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) requires robust validation of field mappings to ensure CRM record updates accurately reflect the MAP hierarchy under the One Customer model for Food and Beverage United (FBU) in Canada.  
MAP 2.0 aggregates harmonized alignment data from Snowflake views (sourced from ERP like EBS/NSAP), and this validation prevents data discrepancies during sync, supporting accurate account-to-user alignments, sales skill ownership, and territory mappings. The rationale is to maintain data integrity post-sync, reducing errors in role assignments and enabling reliable downstream processes like reporting in Power Business Intelligence, while aligning with the Base Customer Account (BCA) structure and Sales Skill designations (initially Hygiene and Water, subject to change). 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Validate field mappings between MAP 2.0 Snowflake views and CRM entities to ensure accurate data reflection. 
 *  Ensure mappings for account-to-user alignments (e.g., SAM, BDM/DM) are consistent and error-free. 
 *  Confirm mappings for sales skill ownership by Base Customer Account (BCA) and sold-to records align with MAP 2.0 data. 
 *  Validate territory and hierarchy mappings for Food and Beverage and Nalco Water divisions post-sync. 
 *  Provide capability to detect and flag mapping conflicts or mismatches during validation. 
 *  Support validation of future extensions (e.g., CAM/AVP roles) without requiring major redesign. 
 

Technical Considerations: 

 *  Validation must integrate with Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines pulling from MAP 2.0 Snowflake views. 
 *  A technical spike is required to assess mapping validation tools and logic for hierarchy consistency. 
 *  Spike output should include a validation framework and benchmarks for real-time vs. batch processing. 
 *  Coordination with MAP 2.0 team to define field schemas and validation thresholds is essential. 
 *  Consider impacts on CRM performance due to validation during large-scale data updates. 
 

Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Validated field mapping configurations between MAP 2.0 and CRM. 
 *  Documentation of mapping validation processes and rules. 
 

Acceptance Criteria 

 *  Develop (or update) field mapping document to align to recent metadata updates. 
 *  Given MAP 2.0 data with account-to-user alignments, when validated against CRM mappings, then all fields match without discrepancies. 
 *  Given sales skill ownership data from MAP 2.0, when mapped to BCA/sold-to, then validation confirms accuracy post-sync. 
 *  Given a territory hierarchy change in MAP 2.0, when validated, then CRM reflects the update correctly for F&B/Nalco Water. 
 *  Given conflicting MAP 2.0 data, when processed, then validation flags the issue and prevents invalid updates. 
 *  Given future role data (e.g., CAM), when added to mappings, then validation supports extension without errors.

This requirement ensures accurate field mapping validation for the MAP 2.0 sync, aligning with the feature's goal of reliable CRM updates. 
Questions for Clarification 

 *  Should Acceptance Criteria for this REQUIREMENT include data volume tests (e.g., high-volume mapping validation)? 
 *  Are there specific tools for mapping validation (e.g., ADF data flows) to note in Technical Considerations? 
 *  For #46, should we include CDM-specific sync aspects (e.g., site alignments)? 
 *  Any preferred naming for Acceptance Criteria (e.g., ""AC1, AC2"") or just bullets? 
 *  Should we generate all remaining Requirements in one message, or continue one at a time?

858897,User Story,,,,,,TECHNICAL SPIKE: NSAP to EBS Ship-To to Sold-To Conversion Requirements,,,"## Problem StatementPlaceholder for solutioning new approach...The Ecolab PZ Migration project requires converting eligible NSAP-based Ship-To accounts to EBS-based Sold-To accounts to enable seamless business operations in the One Customer solution, while ensuring data integrity, maintaining historical references, and supporting future alignment integrations through MAP 2.0.## Detailed Problem Explanation  The core challenge lies in migrating customer account structures from existing NSAP Ship-To configurations to modern EBS Sold-To configurations within Dynamics 365 CRM. This conversion is critical for Ecolab's Food & Beverage division to achieve a unified customer view, but it introduces complexities around data transformation, relationship preservation, and system integration.Key considerations include the need to establish proper linkages to Base Customer Accounts during migration. When converting a Ship-To account, the system must either connect it to an existing Base Customer Account or create a new one if none exists. This ensures hierarchical relationships are maintained and prevents orphaned account data that could disrupt business processes.Account deactivation represents another significant consideration. After successfully promoting a Ship-To to a Sold-To account, the old Ship-To account cannot simply be deleted—it must be properly deactivated. This deactivation process requires careful sequencing to avoid breaking existing business workflows and reporting dependencies.  Service History management emerges as a critical data integrity concern. Before deactivating any Ship-To account, all related Service History references must be cleaned up and restructured. Historical Service History entries should preserve their original linkages to the Ship-To account for audit and compliance purposes, while all future Service History entries must be directed to the new Sold-To account to maintain accurate operational records. The integration with MAP 2.0 adds another layer of complexity. MAP 2.0 serves as the authoritative source for customer alignment and ownership data, pulling from Snowflake views populated by ERP sources like EBS and NSAP. The CRM system must consume this alignment data through scheduled ADF pipelines, ensuring that account hierarchies, user assignments, and territory mappings remain synchronized without manual intervention.  Data transformation requirements demand careful attention to field mappings between NSAP and EBS schemas. Address structures, custom fields, and relationship data must be accurately converted while handling data type differences and validation rules. The transformation logic must account for both full migrations and incremental updates to support ongoing business operations. Performance and scalability considerations are paramount given the enterprise scale of Ecolab's operations. The conversion process must handle varying data volumes without impacting existing pipeline performance, while maintaining security standards and providing robust error handling and rollback capabilities for any conversion failures. Regression testing becomes essential to validate system stability through various migration scenarios. The solution must ensure that alignments remain stable during BCA migrations and CDM site merges, preventing duplicate alignments or conflicting ownerships that could disrupt sales and service operations.  Finally, the integration must support future extensibility. The system should be designed to accommodate additional roles like CAM and AVP as business needs evolve, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing manual assignments that should not be overwritten unintentionally.  ## User Stories  ### User Story 1: Data Extraction and Filtering**As a data analyst, I want to extract and filter the MAP 2.0 subset of ready NSAP Ship-To accounts so that only eligible accounts are processed.**  #### Tasks- Create a new data flow or modify existing ones to query MAP 2.0 data.- Implement filtering logic based on readiness criteria.- Add data validation steps to ensure data quality.  ### User Story 2: Data Transformation Mapping**As a data engineer, I want to map NSAP Ship-To fields to EBS Sold-To fields so that data is correctly transformed during conversion.**  #### Tasks- Develop field mapping specifications.- Implement transformation logic in ADF data flows (joins, derives, lookups).- Handle data type conversions and format changes.  ### User Story 3: Pipeline Integration**As a DevOps engineer, I want to integrate the conversion logic into the existing ADF pipeline so that it runs as part of the regular migration process.**  #### Tasks- Modify pipeline activities to include the new conversion steps.- Add conditional logic for processing only the eligible subset.- Implement error handling and logging for conversion failures.  ### User Story 4: Validation and Testing**As a QA engineer, I want to validate the converted data so that accuracy and completeness are ensured before loading to CRM.**  #### Tasks- Create validation rules and checks.- Develop test cases for various scenarios (e.g., partial data, edge cases).- Implement data comparison tools to verify transformations.  ### User Story 5: Deployment and Monitoring**As a system administrator, I want to deploy the changes and monitor the conversion process so that issues are identified and resolved promptly.**  #### Tasks- Set up monitoring dashboards for conversion metrics.- Implement alerting for failures or data quality issues.- Create rollback procedures for failed conversions.  ### User Story 6: Account Migration and Deactivation**As a data migration engineer, I want to handle the migration of Ship-To accounts to Sold-To accounts with proper Base Customer Account linkage and deactivation so that data integrity is maintained throughout the process.**  #### Tasks- Implement logic to link migrated Sold-To accounts to existing Base Customer Accounts or create new ones as needed.- Develop data cleanup procedures for Service History references before Ship-To account deactivation.- Ensure Service History preserves linkages to old Ship-To accounts for historical records.- Configure future Service History entries to reference the new Sold-To accounts.- Implement account deactivation logic for old Ship-To accounts after data cleanup is complete.  ### User Story 7: TECHNICAL SPIKE - Handle creation of Dynamics CRM accounts from Merging of EBS and NSAP data**As a data engineer, I want to investigate the technical feasibility and implementation approach for creating Dynamics CRM accounts from the merging of EBS and NSAP data so that we can design a robust solution for the Ship-To to Sold-To conversion process.**  #### Tasks- Analyze the data structures and schemas of EBS and NSAP systems to understand merging requirements.- Investigate CRM account creation APIs and upsert capabilities for handling merged data.- Evaluate data quality and deduplication strategies for merged EBS/NSAP records.- Assess the impact on existing CRM workflows and data relationships.- Prototype data flow logic for merging EBS and NSAP data into CRM account structures.- Document findings, recommendations, and potential challenges for the implementation team.  ## Closing StatementThis comprehensive approach to the NSAP to EBS Ship-To to Sold-To conversion addresses the critical business need for unified customer data while maintaining operational continuity and data integrity.

The integration requires defined Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines to consume and sync alignment and account ownership data from MAP 2.0 into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Relationship Management (CRM), supporting the One Customer model for Food and Beverage United (FBU) in Canada. MAP 2.0 aggregates harmonized data from Snowflake views (sourced from ERP like EBS/NSAP) and publishes it to CRM, covering account-to-user alignments (e.g., SAM, BDM/DM), sales skill ownership by Base Customer Account (BCA) and sold-to, territory hierarchies for F&B and Nalco Water, and future extensions (e.g., CAM/AVP). The rationale is to make CRM a reliable downstream consumer of validated alignments, reducing manual maintenance, ensuring data consistency, and enabling stable territory management post-BCA migration and CDM site changes. 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Define new additions to existing ADF pipelines to pull alignment data from MAP 2.0 Snowflake views on a scheduled basis. 
 *  Ensure pipelines support ingestion of account-to-user alignments, sales skill ownership, and territory/hierarchy mappings. 
 *  Provide capability to handle merging logic for sold-to and BCA records during data sync. 
 *  Enable role-based assignment updates in CRM based on MAP 2.0 data, using access teams or role modeling. 
 *  Validate that pipelines do not overwrite existing manual alignments unintentionally. 
 *  Support future role extensions (e.g., CAM/AVP) without major pipeline redesign. 
 

Technical Considerations: 

 *  Pipelines must integrate with Snowflake views populated by ERP sources (EBS/NSAP), using ADF for ETL processes. 
 *  A technical spike is required to assess ADF job scheduling, data volume handling, and validation logic for hierarchy mappings. 
 *  Spike output should include a recommended pipeline architecture and performance benchmarks for real-time vs. batch syncs. 
 *  Coordination with MAP 2.0 and CRM teams is essential to define data schemas and update frequencies. 
 *  Consider potential impacts on CRM performance due to large-scale alignment updates. 
 

Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Defined ADF pipelines for MAP 2.0 to CRM data sync, with scheduled jobs and mapping configurations. 
 *  Documented merging and role assignment logic for sold-to/BCA records. 
 *  Validation framework to prevent duplicate or conflicting alignments. 
 *  Technical spike report with pipeline prototypes and recommendations. 
 

Acceptance Criteria 

 *  Given a scheduled ADF job, when triggered, then alignment data from MAP 2.0 Snowflake views is pulled and synced to CRM without errors. 
 *  Given MAP 2.0 data with sales skill ownership, when processed, then BCA and sold-to records in CRM reflect the mappings accurately. 
 *  Given a merge scenario for sold-to records, when syncing, then CRM updates without data loss or duplication. 
 *  Given existing manual alignments in CRM, when MAP 2.0 sync runs, then manuals are preserved and not overwritten. 
 *  Given future role data (e.g., CAM), when added to MAP 2.0, then pipeline supports extension without reconfiguration.

This requirement ensures the ADF pipeline is defined to support the integration's core data flow, aligning with the feature's goal of making CRM a reliable consumer of MAP 2.0 alignments.  
Outstanding Questions 

 *  Should Acceptance Criteria include performance metrics (e.g., sync time for high-volume data)? 
 *  Are there specific ADF pipeline constraints (e.g., batch size, error thresholds) to include in Technical Considerations?

Locate and Document Current State of ADF Pipeline 

 *  Using attached system architecture diagrams for L2: Map 2.0 (Analytics) and the L3: D365-Snowflake-D as a starting point, develop understanding of how the D365-SNOWFLAKE-D pipeline supports the existing MAP-to-CRM alignment data flow from Snowflake views (sourced from ERP like EBS/NSAP) to Dynamics 365 CRM. 
 *  During exploration, start to develop a future state approach for the pipeline that incorporates merging logic for sold-to and BCA records, Sales Skill ownership mappings (e.g., Hygiene, Water), District handling, market and SINC attributes, and role-based assignments using access teams or role modeling in CRM. (future task)  
 *  Document where the pipeline is located in Azure (e.g., resource group, factory name) and which environments are supported (Development, Quality Assurance, Production). 
 

Analyze Current Logic 

 *  Document how the D365-SNOWFLAKE-D pipeline works today, including required and optional activities (e.g., copy, data flow, lookup), data sources (Snowflake views), linked services (Snowflake, Dataverse/CRM connectors), and staging areas in Azure Data Lake. 
 *  Understand the required schemas, mappings, and transformations for alignment data (e.g., account-to-user alignments like SAM/BDM/DM, territory hierarchies), including any current handling of sales skill or similar fields. 
 *  During discovery and research, capture each activity, dataset, and trigger in the pipeline for a shared documentation repository (e.g., wiki or Confluence page).  
 *  Identify and document Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), including Technical Lead, ADF developer, MAP 2.0 team, and CRM integration specialists. 
 *  Assess current performance impacts on CRM due to large-scale updates, including batch sizes, error thresholds, and data volume handling. 
 

Pipeline Configuration 

 *  Define and locate the existing ADF pipeline D365-SNOWFLAKE-D in Azure portals for Development, Quality Assurance, and Production environments. 
 *  Replicate the pipeline in a development ADF instance, configuring linked services for Snowflake and CRM/Dataverse connectors with sample credentials. 
 *  Add test runs for key activities (e.g., data pull from Snowflake views, transformation for alignments, sync to CRM), with working configurations for each. 
 *  Create a prototype pipeline flow with at least two chained activities: one for data ingestion and validation (e.g., check duplicates or conflicts), and one for submission/sync to CRM. 
 *  Configurations use parameters or variables for pipeline base settings, authentication (e.g., service principals or managed identities), and dynamic data passing (e.g., spike output for performance metrics). 
 

Data Flow Structure  

 *  The ingestion activity uses copy or data flow with schemas matching current MAP 2.0 formats, including required fields: account number, user alignments (SAM, BDM/DM), territory hierarchies.  
 *  Optional fields are supported: sales skill ownership (if present), future extensions like CAM/AVP.  
 *  All mappings align with no-overwrite rules for manual alignments in CRM, as per existing integration constraints. 
 

Successful Execution 

 *  On valid data, the ingestion activity completes with success status, pulling alignment data from MAP 2.0 Snowflake views. 
 *  The sync activity completes, updating CRM with mappings, including confirmation of population in Dataverse (e.g., BCA and sold-to records reflect accurately). 
 

Response Verification 

 *  ADF monitors and tests assert activity success codes, schema validation against expected formats, and ensure no unintended overwrites of manual alignments in CRM. 
 

Authentication Handling 

 *  Document pipeline linked services to include authentication methods (e.g., OAuth for CRM, Snowflake account keys), succeeding with valid credentials. 
 *  Unauthorized or failed connections (e.g., invalid token) trigger ADF error handling, with logging in Azure Monitor. 
 

Data Validation Errors 

 *  Invalid data (e.g., missing required alignment fields) triggers ADF validation activities, rejecting the batch with error codes.  
 *  Merge failures (e.g., conflicting sold-to records) halt the pipeline and log error messages from activities. 
 

Impact Assessment 

 *  ?List areas that may be impacted (e.g., activities, datasets, linked services, transformations, parameters for BCA/Sales Skill/District/market/SINC).   
 *  Document changes required, including additions to system architecture diagrams for integrations. 
 

Duplicate Detection (optional - not sure this is required) 

 *  If duplicates are found (e.g., existing alignments in CRM), validation activity handles merging, preventing overwrites and prompting review if needed.  
 *  Assess how duplicates are handled today; if moving detection upstream, determine if new activities or Snowflake queries are required. 
 

Testing Approach 

 *  Define scenarios to confirm current behavior (e.g., full sync, partial updates) and future behavior (e.g., with Sales Skill extensions).   
 *  Develop a test suite within ADF (e.g., debug runs, sample datasets) for rigorous testing against Development instance. 
 

Integration Runtime Configuration 

 *  Document the type of Integration Runtime (IR) used (e.g., Azure IR, Self-hosted IR, Shared IR), including auto-scaling settings, connectivity to data sources (Snowflake, CRM/Dataverse), and any custom configurations for zone redundancy in the Provisioning Zone context.   
 *  Assess for future state: Recommend IR adjustments for handling increased data volumes from BCA aggregations and Sales Skill mappings, ensuring high availability during migrations. 
 

Triggers and Scheduling 

 *  Analyze current pipeline triggers (e.g., schedule-based, event-based, tumbling window), execution frequencies, dependencies on upstream processes (e.g., Snowflake view refreshes from ERP), and any manual overrides.   
 *  Plan for future: Suggest hybrid scheduling (batch for daily alignments, near-real-time for critical changes like territory hierarchies), including performance metrics for sync times in high-volume scenarios. 
 

Monitoring and Alerting 

 *  Review integration with Azure Monitor, key metrics tracked (e.g., pipeline run duration, activity failures, data throughput), custom logs, and alerting setups (e.g., email notifications for errors). 
 *  Recommend enhancements for future: Custom dashboards for monitoring BCA merge successes, alert thresholds for error rates exceeding defined limits (e.g., 5% failure rate), and integration with Azure Sentinel for anomaly detection. 
 

Security and Compliance (optional) 

 *  Document security features, including authentication mechanisms (managed identities, key vaults for secrets), role-based access control (RBAC) for pipeline execution, data encryption in transit/rest, and compliance with standards (e.g., GDPR for customer data). 
 *  For future state: Evaluate impacts of new fields like market/SINC on PII handling, recommend auditing for role assignments, and ensure zone-redundant setups maintain security postures. 
 

Performance and Cost Optimization (optional)  

 *  Capture current performance details, such as Data Integration Units (DIU) usage, degree of parallelism, write batch sizes for D365 datasets, pipeline run costs, and bottlenecks (e.g., transformation latencies).   
 *  Benchmark and suggest optimizations for future: Tuning for Sales Skill mappings (e.g., reduce DIU for low-volume, scale for peaks), cost estimates for extended roles like CAM/AVP, and recommendations for partitioning in Azure Data Lake staging. 
 

Data Lineage and Dependency Analysis 

 *  Map end-to-end data lineage from ERP sources through Snowflake views, ADF transformations, to CRM entities, identifying dependencies on other pipelines or services (e.g., linked to CDM messages).  
 *  Analyze for future: Document how changes for District/market/SINC affect lineage, recommend tools like Azure Purview for automated tracking, and assess cascading impacts on downstream systems (e.g., Ecolab 3D integrations). 
 

Deliverables 

 *  Technical documentation (memo or wiki) including summary of pipeline analysis, current logic summary, proposed future logic, pseudocode for modifications, risks (e.g., performance on high-volume data), and test outline. 
 *  Create (or update) existing Mapping document used for D365-Snowflake-D. 
 *  Updated prototype pipeline in development ADF that exercises required activities and succeeds (e.g., green run status). (optional) 
 *  Updated prototype for optional extensions (e.g., future role data) that succeeds in development. (optional) 
 *  Effort estimate and prerequisites for implementing changes, including coordination with MAP 2.0 and CRM teams. 
 *  Validation report with performance benchmarks (e.g., sync time for high-volume data, batch size recommendations, error thresholds). (optional)

 *  Map end-to-end data lineage from ERP sources through Snowflake views, ADF transformations, to CRM entities, identifying dependencies on other pipelines or services (e.g., linked to CDM messages).   
 *  Analyze for future: Document how changes for District/market/SINC affect lineage, recommend tools like Azure Purview for automated tracking, and assess cascading impacts on downstream systems (e.g., Ecolab 3D integrations). 
 

Deliverables 

 *  Technical documentation (memo or wiki) including: summary of pipeline analysis, current logic summary, proposed future logic, pseudocode for modifications, risks (e.g., performance on high-volume data), and test outline. 
 *  ?Create (or update) existing Mapping document used for D365-PZMigration-D and D365-Snowflake-D.
 
 *  Updated prototype pipeline in development ADF that exercises required activities and succeeds (e.g., green run status). (optional) 
 *  Updated prototype for optional extensions (e.g., future role data) that succeeds in development. (optional) 
 *  Effort estimate and prerequisites for implementing changes, including coordination with MAP 2.0 and CRM teams. 
 *  Validation report with performance benchmarks (e.g., sync time for high-volume data, batch size recommendations, error thresholds). (optional)

880943,User Story,,,,,,"Enhance EBS SOLD TO Integration Pipeline to Map Market, Submarket for 1C customers",,,"As a consumer of customer master data through the SOLD To pipeline
I want the SOLD To pipeline to populate CRM Market Segment and Subsegment using the correct field set based on whether the customer is 1C or non-1C
 
So that CRM maintains consistent harmonized values during and after 1C adoption, without breaking existing logic for legacy customers.
 

 
Business Context / Rationale

 *  The Sold To pipeline currently pulls legacy fields (Customer Business Unit Description, NAI Description) from MDM for Market Segment and Subsegment. 
 *  Under the 1C program, MDM is introducing harmonized classification fields: Industry ? Market ? Submarket. 
 *  CRM must now support both schemas, because: 
 *  1C customers exclusively use the new harmonized fields. 
 *  Non-1C customers will continue using legacy fields until global harmonization completes. 
 *  The Sold To pipeline must dynamically switch between these sources using the 1C flag provided by MDM. 
 

 
Business Requirements  

 *  The Sold To pipeline must determine the correct source fields using the 1C flag delivered by MDM. 
 *  For 1C = Yes, the Sold To pipeline must populate CRM using: 

 *  Market ? CRM Market Segment 
 *  Submarket ? CRM Subsegment 
 

 *  For 1C = No, the Sold To pipeline must continue using legacy values: 

 *  Customer Business Unit Description ? CRM Market Segment 
 *  NAI Description ? CRM Subsegment

 *  Sold To pipeline uses harmonized fields for 1C customers 

 *  Given MDM sends customer data with 1CFlag = Yes through the Sold To pipeline 
 *  When CRM receives the transformed payload 
 *  Then CRM must populate Market Segment using the “Market” field 
 *  And Subsegment using “Submarket” 
 

 *  Sold To pipeline uses legacy fields for non-1C customers 

 *  Given MDM sends customer data with 1CFlag = No 
 *  When the Sold to pipeline processes the record 
 *  Then CRM must continue populating Market Segment from “Customer Business Unit Description”

Source - MAP 2.0 
Target - CRM Environment (Ecolab Test) 

 
Scenario 1 

 
1. Precondition - A new Ship-to account arrives from EBS with MAP 2.0 alignments.
2. Post the processing of account through integration pipeline, a new Ship-to account along with all the mapped attributes is created in Dynamics 365 CRM.
 
3. Separate Ship-to accounts should be created for Hygiene and Water and the respective ERP Sales Skill should be tagged to the account.
4. The Ship-to accounts should be linked to the respective Sales Skill Customer Accounts.
 

 
Scenario 2 

 
1. Precondition - An already existing Ship-to account needs updates from MAP 2.0 data.
2. Post the processing of account through integration pipeline, all the required information is updated to the Ship-to account from mapping document.
 
3. If new sales skill is added to a Sold-to account, then a corresponding Ship-to account must be created in Dynamics if it was not existing  	previously.
 

 
Scenario 3  

  
1. Precondition - A Ship-to account has different territory alignment than it's parent Sold-to.
2. Post the processing of account through integration pipeline, the Ship-to account inherits all the appropriate organizational data but retains it's specific territory assignments.
  

 
Scenario 4 

 
1. Precondition - A new Ship-To account is created in Dynamics 365 based on mapping document. 
2. Verify that the Ship-to accounts are properly parented to the Sold-to accounts (The Billing Account on the ShipTo will point to the Sold-To Account) 
3. Verify that the Ship-To Owner and Primary Owner is set as the associated Sold-To Owner and Primary Owner respectively 

 
Scenario 5 

 
1.Precondition - A new Ship-To account is created in Dynamics 365 based on mapping document. 
2.Verify that Ship-To are only created for Sold-To Account associated to Districts with 1C flag as 'Yes'. 
3.Verify that Ship-To accounts in EBS with Deletion Flag updated as 'Yes' is not created/updated in CRM.

893697,User Story,,,,,,ADF: Update SHIP-To ADF Pipeline to Populate Site from Sold-To Account for 1C (FBU) and Water Accounts,,,"As an Integration Engineer I want the ADF SHIP-To pipeline to derive and populate the Site value from the Sold-To account So that 
 all 1C (FBU) Hygiene and Water accounts consistently use the same Site reference and stay aligned with Hygiene accounts.

 
Context and Background: 

 *  Under the One Customer (1C) program, Hygiene (EBS) and Water (NALCO/NSAP) accounts that belong to the same global customer must share a single unified Site in CRM. 
 *  Today: 

 *  Hygiene accounts (FBU) store the Site directly on the Sold-To account. 
 *  Water accounts store multiple SHIP-To records, and each SHIP-To stores its own Site reference independently. 
 

 *  With 1C merging, Water SHIP-To records must inherit the same Site that Hygiene accounts already use, ensuring: 

 *  Consistent Site alignment across divisions 
 *  Site Lookup needs to have the same value for Water Accounts on the Customer Account Record and the Ship To Account Record 
 

 

 
 
Why the ADF SHIP-To Pipeline Must Change?

 *  When a SHIP-To is created or updated via ADF: 

 *  It must inspect the parent Sold-To (Customer) account. 
 *  It must determine if the Sold-To is a 1C account 
 *  (i.e., linked to a District where the 1C Flag = Yes). 
 *  If yes ? it must copy the Site from the Sold-To account onto the SHIP-To. 
 *  If no ? follow existing Water/NSAP logic (do not populate Site via CRM). 
 

 

 
 
","Gupta, Ayush",In Development,,\FBU 1C\Data,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 26.17.05,2,Moved out of state Sprint Ready,Business,1," *  Identify When the Pipeline Must Populate Site 

 *  Given a SHIP-To record is being created or updated 

 *  And the parent Sold-To is linked to a District where 1C Flag = Yes 
 *  Then the pipeline must populate the Site field on the SHIP-To. 
 

 *  Given the parent Sold-To is not part of an FBU/1C district 

 *  Then the pipeline must not modify the Site reference.

834315,Feature,,,,Integration: CRM Integration with CDM – Account and User Alignment Sync,,,,,"This feature supports the flow of Account and User alignment data from CDM into CRM to keep customer structures accurate and up to date.
 
 

 
 
Today’s Setup:
 

 *  CDM sends account and user alignment data to CRM using Azure Service Bus (event-driven). 
 *  Manual API pull option is available in CRM when messages are skipped or out-of-sync. 
 *  CRM uses a combination of site ID and account number to match records. 
 

 

 
What’s Changing / Key Enhancements:
 

 *  CDM may send multiple records (arrays) sharing the same account number — CRM must handle these properly. 
 *  New fields like Sales Skill are being introduced (or renamed), replacing older fields like Global Business Unit. 
 *  Some fields in CDM may be null or missing — CRM should avoid overwriting existing values in such cases. 
 *  CDM site messages may still arrive out of order with asset messages — CRM should handle thin site creation and enrichment. 
 *  Manual pull and retry handling for failed messages (dead-letter logic) must remain intact and be revalidated. 
 

 
Areas That Will Require Code Changes or Attention: 

 *  CRM integration logic needs updates to support renamed/new fields like Sales Skill. 
 *  CRM must support upsert logic that protects CRM-specific fields when CDM doesn’t send values. 
 *  Handle array-based messages in change feed payloads gracefully. 
 *  Ensure thin site handling and enrichment logic remains valid. 
 *  Reconfirm manual pull mechanism functions reliably and avoids duplication. 
 

 
Regression and Testing Needed In: 

 *  Site create and update flows from CDM ? CRM. 
 *  Manual site data pull functionality in CRM UI. 
 *  Partner role assignment: Sold-To, Ship-To, etc. 
 *  Handling missing or skipped messages (retry logic). 
 *  Scenarios where assets are received before sites. 
 *  Message processing for shared account numbers. 
 *  Message purging after 90-day retry window (dead-letter validation). 
 

 
Why This Matters: 

 *  Keeps CRM aligned with CDM as the system of record for site and sales alignment. 
 *  Ensures reliable setup of customer hierarchy and sales visibility in CRM. 
 *  Prevents data quality issues that could disrupt service, reporting, or integration with downstream apps like Ecolab 3D.

 *  Using ATTACHED System Architecture diagram for Master Data Management as a starting point, develop your understanding of how MDM supports the existing Customer Setup process from a Web API perspective against the EXISTING Customer Setup Process. (Look at existing Flow to understand where and when the API's are getting called). 
 *  During your exploration, start to develop a future state approach to Customer Setup that supports new Sales Skill and ""special"" handling of Accounts that have the 1C customer flag set that will require modifications to the existing MDM API (v2) and corresponding payloads. 
 *  Document where the API is located and which environment are supported 
 

Analyze Current Logic 
 

 *  Document how Customer Setup Process works with MDM API today, including the required (and optional) calls used. Leverage existing MDM Diagram attached to this ticket. 
 *  Understand the required payload and JSON format required for each endpoint 
 *  During discovery (and research) capture each endpoint, we will use for shared Postman Collection 
 *  Leverage provide Postman Collection environment to setup additional Client Id and Client Secret to call live 
 *  Identify (and document) Subject Matter expert to include Technica Lead and MDM API developer 
 

 
API Configuration 

 *  Define and locate the existing MDM API for Development? Quality Assurance? Production? 
 *  Add (or Update) a Postman Request for each of the defined endpoints, Address Verification, Duplication Check and Submit (Prospect) with working payloads for each endpoint 
 *  Add (or Update) a Postman request for existing optional, with working payloads for each 
 *  A Postman collection is created with at least two chained requests: one for validation (e.g., check duplicates and address) and one for submission to the MDM create endpoint. 
 *  Requests use environment variables for API base URL, authentication tokens, and dynamic data passing (e.g., validation response ID used in create request). 
 

 
JSON Payload Structure 

 *  The submission request uses a POST method with a JSON body matching the current Account format, including required fields: baseCustomerAccountNumber (text), customerName (text). 
 *  Optional fields are supported: mdmSiteId (text), erpAccountStatus (option set: Active/Inactive). 
 *  All fields align with read-only constraints post-creation, as per existing integration rules. 
 

 
Successful Submission
 

 *  On valid data, the validation request returns 200 OK with confirmation (no duplicates, valid address). 
 *  The create request returns 201 Created, with response including the new account ID and confirmation of population in MDM (e.g., Snowflake or Dataverse). 
 

 
	
Response Verification 

 *  Postman tests assert response codes, JSON schema validation against expected format, and ensure no manual edit fields are returned as editable in the response. 
 

 
 
Authentication Handling 

 *  Document requests to include API key or OAuth token in headers, succeeding with valid credentials. 
 *  Unauthorized requests (e.g., invalid token) return 401 Unauthorized, with logging in Postman console. Data Validation Errors 
 *  How is Invalid JSON handled for the Mulesoft-based API (e.g., missing required field like customerName) returns 400 Bad Request from the API. 
 *  When the call fails, how do we address validation failure (e.g., invalid format) halts the chain and displays error message from response. 
 

 
Impact Assessment 

 *  List areas that maybe be impacted (forms, plug-in, javascript, endpoint addition, json payload, parameters)  
 *  Document changes required we will add to existing System Architecture for Integrations 
 

Duplicate Detection  

 *  If duplicates are found (e.g., existing accountNumber), validation request returns 409 Conflict, preventing submission and prompting user review. 
 *  How are these handled today, if we moved the duplicate detection upstream can we leverage the existing logic or will we need a new MDM endpoint 
 

Testing Approach 

 *  Define scenarios to confirm current behavior? future behavior?  
 *  Develop Integration Test Suite within Postman Collection for more rigorous testing against DEVELOPMENT instance of MDM API. 
 

 
Deliverables 

 *  Technical documentation (memo or wiki) including, summary of Postman Updates, current logic summary, proposed logic, pseudocode, risks, and test outline.  
 *  Updated (working) endpoint that we can call against development that exercises the REQUIRED endpoints and returns a 200 result in Postman.  
 *  Updated (working) endpoint that we can call against development that exercises the OIPTIONAL endpoints and returns a 200 result in Postman.
  
 *  Effort estimate and prerequisites for implementing the change.

855466,Task,,,,,,,Using Postman for Unit and Integration Testing of CDM Changefeed with Azure Service Bus,,"# Architecture Decision Record: Using Postman for Unit and Integration Testing of CDM Changefeed with Azure Service Bus## StatusProposed## ContextThe Customer Data Management (CDM) system requires a robust testing strategy to validate its changefeed, a stream of events reflecting real-time updates to customer records (e.g., creates, updates, deletes). These events are published to Azure Service Bus queues or topics for downstream processing by various services, such as analytics or synchronization modules. Ensuring the reliability of this changefeed is critical, as it underpins data consistency across the platform. Testing must verify both the generation of correct event messages and their successful delivery and retrieval through Service Bus.Azure Service Bus uses Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for authentication in its REST API, which requires generating time-bound tokens based on a Shared Access Policy. Manual testing of these interactions is error-prone and time-consuming, especially for validating complex workflows like sending and consuming changefeed events. Automated testing is essential to ensure scalability and repeatability, particularly in development and CI/CD environments.We need a tool that supports both unit testing (e.g., validating SAS token generation or message format) and integration testing (e.g., end-to-end message flow through Service Bus). The tool should be accessible to developers with varying expertise, support rapid iteration, and integrate with existing workflows. Postman, a widely-used API testing platform, offers a visual interface, JavaScript-based scripting for automation, and collection-based test suites that can be shared and run in CI pipelines via Newman. This ADR evaluates Postman as the primary tool for these testing needs.## DecisionWe will use Postman to conduct unit and integration testing for the CDM changefeed with Azure Service Bus. The approach involves:1. **Environment Configuration**: Set up a Postman Environment to store Service Bus configuration variables (namespace, queue/topic, key name, key), enabling flexible switching between test contexts (e.g., dev vs staging).2. **SAS Token Generation**: Implement a pre-request script to dynamically generate SAS tokens using JavaScript and Postman’s built-in CryptoJS library, ensuring secure and automated authentication for API calls.3. **Unit Testing**: Use Postman’s test scripts to validate isolated components, such as the correctness of SAS tokens and event message structures, through assertions.4. **Integration Testing**: Create Postman collections to simulate changefeed workflows, chaining requests to send customer events to a queue and retrieve them, with assertions to verify successful delivery and content.5. **Reusability**: Develop a Node.js library to encapsulate SAS token generation logic, reusable in Postman scripts and external test frameworks, enhancing maintainability.This decision leverages Postman’s strengths in rapid prototyping, team collaboration, and CI integration while addressing the specific needs of testing the CDM changefeed’s interaction with Service Bus.### Implementation Details#### Postman Environment SetupCreate an environment named “CDM Changefeed Test” with the following variables:- `sb_namespace`: Service Bus namespace (e.g., “cdm-servicebus”), type “default”.- `sb_queue`: Queue name for changefeed events (e.g., “customer-updates”), type “default”.- `sb_keyname`: Shared Access Policy name (e.g., “ChangeFeedPolicy”), type “default”.- `sb_key`: Primary key string, type “secret” for security.Select this environment in Postman to make variables accessible via `pm.environment.get()`.#### SAS Token Generation ScriptFor both unit and integration tests, use a pre-request script to generate SAS tokens. Place this at the collection level for unified testing:```javascript// Generate SAS token for Azure Service Busconst namespace = pm.environment.get('sb_namespace');const queue = pm.environment.get('sb_queue');const keyName = pm.environment.get('sb_keyname');const key = pm.environment.get('sb_key');// Validate inputsif (!namespace || !queue || !keyName || !key) {    console.error('Missing environment variables');    pm.environment.set('sb_token', null);    return;}// Resource URIconst uri = `https://${namespace}.servicebus.windows.net/${queue}`;// Expiry (1 hour)const ttl = 3600;const expiry = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + ttl;// String to signconst encodedUri = encodeURIComponent(uri);const stringToSign = encodedUri + '\n' + expiry;// Compute HMAC-SHA256const hmac = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(stringToSign, key);const signature = hmac.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);const encodedSignature = encodeURIComponent(signature);// Build tokenconst token = `SharedAccessSignature sig=${encodedSignature}&se=${expiry}&skn=${keyName}&sr=${encodedUri}`;pm.environment.set('sb_token', token);```#### Unit Testing in PostmanUnit tests validate isolated logic, such as SAS token format or message structure. Add tests in the “Tests” tab of a request or use a dedicated “Unit Test” request with no HTTP call:```javascript// Unit test: Validate SAS token formatpm.test(""SAS token has correct structure"", () => {    const token = pm.environment.get('sb_token');    pm.expect(token).to.match(/^SharedAccessSignature sig=.+&se=\d+&skn=.+&sr=.+$/);});// Unit test: Validate changefeed event formatconst sampleEvent = { customerId: ""123"", action: ""update"", data: { name: ""John Doe"" } };pm.test(""Event JSON is valid"", () => {    pm.expect(sampleEvent).to.have.property('customerId').that.is.a('string');    pm.expect(sampleEvent).to.have.property('action').that.is.oneOf(['create', 'update', 'delete']);    pm.expect(sampleEvent).to.have.property('data').that.is.an('object');});```#### Integration TestingCreate a collection “CDM Changefeed Tests” with requests to simulate the changefeed workflow. Use the collection-level pre-request script above.**Example 1: Sending a Changefeed Event**- Request: POST `https://{{sb_namespace}}.servicebus.windows.net/{{sb_queue}}/messages`- Headers:  - Authorization: `{{sb_token}}`  - Content-Type: `application/json`- Body (raw JSON): `{""customerId"": ""123"", ""action"": ""update"", ""data"": {""name"": ""Jane Doe"", ""email"": ""jane@example.com""}}`- Tests:```javascriptpm.test(""Event sent successfully"", () => {    pm.response.to.have.status(201);});```Run and verify in Azure portal: Queue’s active message count increases.**Example 2: Receiving a Changefeed Event (Peek-Lock)**- Request: GET `https://{{sb_namespace}}.servicebus.windows.net/{{sb_queue}}/messages/head?timeout=30`- Headers: Same as above.- Tests:```javascriptpm.test(""Event received successfully"", () => {    pm.response.to.have.status(200);    const message = pm.response.json();    pm.expect(message).to.have.property('customerId').that.is.a('string');});```Chain these in Postman’s Collection Runner to simulate end-to-end flow.#### Reusable LibraryTo extend beyond Postman, create a Node.js package `cdm-sas-token`:1. Initialize: `mkdir cdm-sas-token && cd cdm-sas-token && npm init -y`2. Create `index.js`:```javascriptconst crypto = require('crypto');/** * Generates SAS token for Azure Service Bus. * @param {string} uri - Service Bus resource URI * @param {string} keyName - Policy name * @param {string} key - Shared access key * @param {number} [ttl=3600] - Expiry in seconds * @returns {string} SAS token */function generateSasToken(uri, keyName, key, ttl = 3600) {    const encodedUri = encodeURIComponent(uri);    const expiry = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + ttl;    const stringToSign = encodedUri + '\n' + expiry;    const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', key);    hmac.update(stringToSign);    const signature = hmac.digest('base64');    return `SharedAccessSignature sig=${encodeURIComponent(signature)}&se=${expiry}&skn=${keyName}&sr=${encodedUri}`;}module.exports = { generateSasToken };```3. Update `package.json`: Set `""main"": ""index.js""`, `""description"": ""SAS token generator for CDM changefeed testing""`.4. Add `README.md` with usage example:```javascriptconst { generateSasToken } = require('cdm-sas-token');const token = generateSasToken('https://cdm-servicebus.servicebus.windows.net/customer-updates', 'ChangeFeedPolicy', 'your-key', 7200);console.log(token);```## Consequences**Benefits**:- **Rapid Prototyping**: Postman’s UI and scripting enable quick test setup without coding full applications.- **Team Collaboration**: Collections and environments are shareable, supporting team workflows.- **CI Integration**: Newman CLI allows running tests in pipelines, ensuring continuous validation.- **Reusability**: The Node.js library extends SAS generation to other tools, reducing duplication.**Drawbacks**:- **Limited Unit Testing**: Postman’s scripting is less robust than dedicated frameworks like Jest for complex logic.- **Learning Curve**: Teams unfamiliar with Postman may need training.- **Dependency**: Relies on Postman’s ecosystem, potentially limiting if the tool changes.**Mitigations**:- Supplement with Jest for deeper unit tests if needed.- Provide team onboarding with Postman tutorials.- Encapsulate logic in the library to decouple from Postman long-term.## StatusProposed. Awaiting team feedback and validation through pilot testing with the CDM changefeed.## Additional Notes- **Testing**: Validate setup with a test queue in Azure. Use Newman for CI runs: `newman run cdm-changefeed-tests.json -e cdm-env.json`.- **Next Steps**: Integrate into CI/CD, explore Azure AD for production auth, and document in a support article for broader dissemination.---This ADR captures the decision to use Postman, detailing setup, testing strategies, and a reusable library, tailored to the CDM changefeed’s needs with Service Bus. It balances rapid iteration with scalability, addressing both unit and integration testing requirements.","Kumari, Ankita",Removed,Integration; TECHNICAL SPIKE,\FBU 1C,"Blaszyk, David",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.04,1,Removed from the backlog,,1,,,Development,,,,

834686,Requirement,,,,,42. Account (aka. Site) and Role Update Logic Based on CDM Messages,,,,"The integration between Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Central Data Management (CDM) requires logic to process CDM messages for updating site and role data under the One Customer model for Food and Beverage United (FBU) in Canada. With the Base Customer Account (BCA) aggregating Sales Skill Accounts (initially Hygiene and Water, subject to change), CDM messages will drive real-time updates to site hierarchies and user roles. The rationale is to ensure accurate reflection of site merges/splits and role assignments in CRM, enhancing operational efficiency and supporting enterprise-level data consistency. 
NOTE: Site and User alignment is NOT impacted by the BCA changes, but does need to preserve metadata. Change feed works at the account-level ONLY. 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Process CDM messages to update Account (aka. Site) data (e.g., merges, splits) within the BCA structure in CRM. 
 *  Update user role assignments based on CDM messages, aligning with Sales Skill designations (Hygiene, Water). 
 *  Ensure site and role updates maintain referential integrity with existing CRM records (e.g., assets, opportunities). 
 *  Support dynamic adjustment of site hierarchies and role mappings in response to CDM-driven changes. 
 *  Provide capability to validate updates against CDM data to prevent data discrepancies. 
 

Technical Considerations: 

 *  Integration uses Azure Service Bus (aka. changefeed) to handle CDM message processing. 
 *  Azure Data Factory (ADF) is used to populate the Analytics layer from the existing Snowflake staging layer. 
 *  Spike output should include a validated update schema 
 *  Coordination with CDM team to align message formats and update frequencies is essential. 
 

Acceptance Criteria 

 *  Given a CDM message for a site merge, when processed, then the updated site hierarchy in CRM reflects the merge without data loss. 
 *  Given a CDM message for a role change, when applied, then the user role in CRM updates to match Sales Skill (e.g., Hygiene, Water). 
 *  Given a CDM message with invalid data, when processed, then an error is logged, and the update is rejected. 
 *  Given a site update, when validated against CDM, then no discrepancies exist between systems.

As the CDM Message Processing System, I need to update user role assignments based on CDM messages, aligning with Sales Skill designations (Hygiene, Water), so that roles are correctly assigned and operational efficiency is enhanced in CRM. 
 

 
","Gupta, Siddharth",New,Integration; Inventory; Refine,\FBU 1C\Data,"Blaszyk, David",\One Dynamics\PI17 Backlog,2,New,Business,3,"Trigger on User Role Assignment Changes 

 *  Role update triggered automatically after site merge/split processing, via same or linked message. 
 *  Extract role changes from message, linked to Sales Skills (Hygiene, Water). 
 

 
Role Assignment Update 

 *  Given a CDM message for a role change, when applied, then the user role in CRM updates to match Sales Skill (e.g., Hygiene). 
 *  Given a CDM message with invalid role data, when processed, then an error is logged, and the update is rejected. 
 *  Given a role update, when validated against CDM, then no discrepancies exist between systems. 
 *  Given a normal update with multiple Sales Skill designations, when processed, then roles are assigned under BCA without conflicts. 
 

 
Validation 

 *  Verify updated roles against CDM via API call (e.g., GetRolesForAccount). 
 *  Ensure no security model breaches, log discrepancies. 
 

 
Error Handling 

 *  Invalid role data rejects update, logs error. 
 *  Conflicts (e.g., role overlaps) handled with fallback to default. 
 

 
Logging 

 *  Log role before/after, with audit trail. (Application Insights?)

we need to perform a deep-dive analysis of the existing Azure Functions in the Ecolab.CRM.Azure.CDM namespace and supporting libraries that handle CDM-based change feed data via Azure Service Bus, documenting their current state including triggers, message processing logic, CRM integrations, and API calls, while developing a future state approach that supports site merges/splits, role updates, Base Customer Account (BCA) aggregation, Sales Skill mappings (e.g., Hygiene, Water), null/missing field handling, out-of-order messages (e.g., assets before sites), and validation against CDM,  
So that we can surface design-level details for modifications to ensure seamless CDM to CRM site and alignment sync without manual intervention, maintaining data consistency under the One Customer model for FBU in Canada.

 *  Using attached system architecture diagrams for Customer Data Management (e.g., CDM Change Feed to Service Bus middleware like cds-cdm-servicbus-001 and qa-ecolabcdm) as a starting point, develop understanding of how the Azure Functions (e.g., ReadSubscriptionMessage, ReadAccountAlignmentSubscriptionMessage) support the existing CDM to CRM site and alignment data flow via Service Bus messages. 
 *  During exploration, start to develop a future state approach for the functions that incorporates logic for site merges/splits within BCA structures, user role assignments aligned with Sales Skill designations, referential integrity for CRM records (e.g., assets, opportunities), dynamic hierarchy adjustments, and discrepancy validation against CDM. 
 *  Document where the functions are located in Azure (e.g., Function App name, resource group, namespace Ecolab.CRM.Azure.CDM) and which environments are supported (Development, Quality Assurance, Production). 
 

Analyze Current Logic 

 *  Document how the Azure Functions work today, including required and optional components (e.g., Service Bus triggers, message parsing in ProcessSubscriptionMessage, CRM service connections, API calls like AlignmentControllers/GetRolesForAccount), data sources (CDM change feed messages), and processing flows (e.g., queue vs. topic subscriptions). 
 *  Understand the required code structures, methods, and transformations for site/alignment data (e.g., updating CRM records via CrmServiceClient, role refresh in RefreshRolesForAccountLogic), including any current handling of sales skill or similar fields. 
 *  During discovery and research, capture each function, class, and method (e.g., ProcessForTopic, GetExistingRolesForAccountsInCRM) for a shared documentation repository (e.g., wiki or Confluence page), including dependencies on libraries like Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector. 
 *  Identify and document Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), including Technical Lead, Azure Function developer, CDM team, and CRM integration specialists. 
 *  Assess current performance impacts on CRM due to message processing, including throughput, error rates, and handling of high-volume change feeds. 
 

Function Configuration 

 *  Define and locate the existing Azure Functions (e.g., CDMIntegrationFunction for queues, CDMDeadLetterMessageToMainQueue for timers) in Azure portals for Development, Quality Assurance, and Production environments. 
 *  Establish Azure Service bus explorer as the de-facto tool for handling change feeds for the cds-cdm-servicebus-001-i 
 *  Replicate the functions in a development Function App instance, configuring host.json, local.settings.json, and environment variables (e.g., CRM_URL, SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION) with sample credentials.   
 *  Add test invocations for key functions (e.g., simulate Service Bus message for site update, role refresh via HTTP trigger), with working configurations for each.   
 *  Create a prototype function flow with at least two related calls: one for message reception and validation (e.g., parse CDM payload, check duplicates), and one for CRM update/sync.   
 *  Configurations use app settings or variables for function base settings, authentication (e.g., CRM_SERVICEUSERNAME/PWD), and dynamic data passing (e.g., spike output for performance metrics).  
  

Code Structure 

 *  The message processing uses C# classes with methods matching current CDM formats, including required fields: site ID, account number, user alignments, role codes. 
 *  Optional fields are supported: sales skill designations (if present), future extensions like market/SINC. 
 *  All logic aligns with no-overwrite rules for CRM-specific fields when CDM sends null/missing values, as per existing integration constraints. 
 

Successful Execution 

 *  On valid CDM message (e.g., site merge), the reception function completes with success, parsing data from Service Bus. 
 *  The update function completes, syncing to CRM with changes reflected (e.g., merged site hierarchy in BCA without data loss). 
 

Response Verification 

 *  Function logs and tests assert execution success, payload validation against expected formats, and ensure no unintended overwrites of existing CRM values. 
 

Authentication Handling 

 *  Document function authentication methods (e.g., username/password for CRM, connection strings for Service Bus), succeeding with valid credentials. 
 *  Unauthorized or failed connections (e.g., invalid CRM credentials) trigger function error handling, with logging in Application Insights. 
 

Data Validation Errors 

 *  Invalid message data (e.g., missing site ID) triggers validation logic, rejecting the process with error codes logged.  
 *  Out-of-order failures (e.g., asset before site) handle enrichment or buffering, logging if unresolvable. 
 

Impact Assessment 

 *  List areas that may be impacted (e.g., functions, classes, methods, environment variables for Sales Skill/BCA/site merges/role updates/out-of-order handling). 
 *  Document changes required, including additions to system architecture diagrams for CDM integrations. 
 

 

Testing Approach 

 *  Define scenarios to confirm current behavior (e.g., standard message processing, manual pull) and future behavior (e.g., with Sales Skill and null handling). 
 *  Develop a test suite using tools like Postman for HTTP triggers or Service Bus explorer for messages, for rigorous testing against Development instance. 
 

Integration Runtime Configuration (Nice-to-have) 

 *  Document the Function runtime (.NET version, e.g., v4), hosting plan (Consumption/Premium), scaling settings, connectivity to services (Service Bus, CRM), and any custom configurations. 
 *  Assess for future state: Recommend runtime adjustments for handling increased message volumes from CDM changes, ensuring high availability during peaks.  
 

Triggers and Scheduling 

 *  Analyze current function triggers (e.g., Service Bus for messages, Timer for dead-letter processing), execution patterns, dependencies on upstream CDM feeds, and any manual invocations. 
 *  Plan for future: Suggest trigger enhancements (e.g., session-enabled for ordered processing, hybrid for real-time validation), including performance metrics for message handling times.  
 

Monitoring and Alerting 

 *  Review integration with Application Insights, key metrics tracked (e.g., invocation duration, failures, throughput), custom telemetry, and alerting setups (e.g., notifications for dead-letter spikes). 
 *  Recommend enhancements for future: Custom dashboards for monitoring site merge successes, alert thresholds for error rates (e.g., 5% failure), and integration with Azure Monitor for anomaly detection. 
 

Security and Compliance 

 *  Document security features, including authentication (env vars, managed identities if used), RBAC for function execution, message encryption, and compliance with standards (e.g., GDPR for customer data). 
 *  For future state: Evaluate impacts of new logic like role updates on security models, recommend auditing for alignments, and ensure setups maintain compliance. 
 

Performance and Cost Optimization 

 *  Capture current performance details, such as execution times, cold starts, consumption units, costs, and bottlenecks (e.g., CRM API latencies). 
 *  Benchmark and suggest optimizations for future: Tuning for out-of-order handling (e.g., caching, async), cost estimates for increased invocations, and recommendations for Premium plans. 
 

Data Lineage and Dependency Analysis 

 *  Map end-to-end lineage from CDM change feed through Service Bus, function processing, to CRM updates, identifying dependencies on libraries (e.g., Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk) or other functions. 
 *  Analyze for future: Document how changes for Sales Skill/site merges affect lineage, recommend tools like Azure Purview for tracking, and assess impacts on connected external applications (e.g., Ecolab 3D). 
 

Deliverables 

 *  Technical documentation (memo or wiki) including: summary of functions analysis, current logic summary, proposed future logic, pseudocode for modifications, risks (e.g., performance on high-volume messages), and test outline. 
 *  Updated prototype (or existing) functions in development App that exercise required logic and succeed (e.g., processed message status). 
 *  Updated prototype for optional extensions (e.g., array handling if re-enabled) that succeeds in development. 
 *  Effort estimate and prerequisites for implementing changes, including coordination with CDM and CRM teams.  
 *  Validation report with performance benchmarks (e.g., message processing time, scalability recommendations, error thresholds).

834671,Requirement,,,,,32. Allow CDM User Enablement for Hygiene Division Reps,,,,"Business Objective
 
Enable sales representatives from the Hygiene (F&B) division to access Ecolab’s digital tools (such as Ecolab 3D) by integrating their user enablement process into the existing CRM-CDM setup. This ensures a consistent experience across divisions, reduces manual overhead, and prepares for business convergence under the One Customer model. 

 
Currently, CDM user setup is functional only for Nalco Water. With the ongoing integration of the Hygiene division into shared CRM and CDM structures (especially with shared account numbers and BCA architecture), the ability to digitally enable Hygiene reps is a critical business need. The goal is to extend the automation used for Nalco Water to Hygiene while accommodating their distinct business workflows, governance models, and upcoming E3D access.
 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Enable CDM user creation for Hygiene sales reps when the “Enable for Digital Tools” button is clicked in CRM. 
 *  System must check: 

 *  If the email domain is authorized for digital enablement. 
 *  If the account type and ERP system align with known patterns for Hygiene reps. 
 *  If the site is marked as E3D enabled. 
 

 *  Allow division-specific rules to be introduced: 

 *  Hygiene reps may require different domain authorization logic. 
 *  Regional or segment-specific enablement flows should be supported if needed. 
 

 *  Maintain consistency with Nalco Water’s existing user enablement process: 

 *  Placeholder CDM user record is created. 
 *  A webhook triggers Azure Function to call CDM APIs. 
 *  Upon confirmation, CRM record status is updated from “Sent” to “Active”. 
 

 *  Ensure Hygiene reps are properly aligned to accounts and roles in CDM (e.g., Sold-To level roles). 
 *  Prevent duplication or conflict of users when Water and Hygiene share the same account number: 

 *  Support logic to identify and track reps from different divisions using new metadata (e.g., Global Business Type). 
 

 *  Avoid Duplicate Contacts and Preserve Site Access 

 *  Contacts with the same email ID under different Sold-To accounts (Water & Hygiene) must not create duplicate CDM users unless needed. 
 *  If a user is associated with multiple accounts/sites, access should aggregate rather than restrict. 
 *  Security filters must be enhanced to ensure reps see only the appropriate data within CRM and Ecolab 3D. 
 

 *  All actions and changes must preserve alignment with the One Customer model, including cross-division account sharing. 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  The existing integration is webhook and Azure Function based, designed for Water users. 
 *  A technical spike is required to: 

 *  Understand how Hygiene reps and sites are configured in CDM. 
 *  Confirm whether existing webhook + Azure Function pattern supports Hygiene flows without major refactor. 
 *  Review and test domain logic for Hygiene email domains (manually managed today). 
 

 *  Looping logic in the CDM user creation and alignment process must be enhanced: 

 *  Today, code assumes account number is unique. 
 *  Post-BCA, both Water and Hygiene may share the same number. 
 *  CRM/CDM integration must be updated to loop through multiple matches, filter by division, and align users accordingly. 
 

 *  Visibility and alignment rules must be confirmed with the CDM team to avoid conflicts between Water and Hygiene contact and user records. 
 *  A review of contact duplication handling will be needed to ensure proper segmentation of reps across divisions and preserve history. 
 

 
Dependency 

 *  This requirement is dependent on the successful completion of the separate Project, which is responsible for enabling Hygiene users and sites in Ecolab 3D. 
 *  User enablement in CDM for Hygiene cannot proceed until: 

 *  E3D enablement logic is confirmed for Hygiene sites. 
 *  Domain governance and alignment strategy are finalized. 
 

 *  Fix Role Assignment Logic for Shared Account Numbers: 

 *  Currently, the CRM-CDM integration assumes that account numbers are unique across divisions. With the introduction of the One Customer (BCA) structure, both Nalco Water and Hygiene (F&B) may share the same account number in CRM. The existing user alignment logic must be updated to correctly loop through multiple matching account records and assign roles to the correct Sold-To account based on the Global Business Type (e.g., Water or Hygiene) or Division filter. 
 *  This ensures that users are not misaligned or assigned duplicate roles across both business units. 
 *  A technical spike is required to analyze the current logic and identify all code references that assume account number uniqueness. 
 

 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Hygiene reps can be successfully enabled in CDM from CRM using the Enable for Digital Tools button. 
 *  Updated webhook logic and Azure Function handle Hygiene-specific criteria. 
 *  Looping logic and CDM API integration support duplicate account numbers across divisions. 
 *  Hygiene users are aligned correctly to Sold-To roles in CDM. 
 *  Email domain authorization logic supports Hygiene rules (either via existing or new mechanism). 
 *  No conflict occurs between Nalco Water and Hygiene user records even if account numbers overlap. 
 *  Updated user alignment logic to correctly handle scenarios where multiple CRM accounts exist with the same account number across Water and Hygiene divisions. 
 *  Ensure user roles are assigned only to the appropriate Sold-To account, based on division-specific rules or identifiers (e.g., Global Business Type). 
 *  No duplicate role creation or cross-division misalignments. 
 *  Regression testing across merged account scenarios to confirm expected user enablement and alignment. 
 *  All changes are regression-tested to ensure existing Nalco Water logic is not impacted.

853245,User Story,,,,,,TECHNICAL SPIKE: Investigate the CRM -> CDM integrations (Enable for Digital Tools),,,"As an Integration Specialist,  
I need to perform a deep-dive analysis of the existing CRM to CDM integrations for user enablement and digital tools, documenting current logic including webhook triggers, API calls (e.g., AlignToAccount, Register API, AlignByRoleName), email domain/E3D eligibility checks, and role/site alignment processes, while developing a future state approach that supports the One Customer model with shared account numbers, multiple matching accounts, extension to Hygiene business units with division-based filters, and handling of duplicate records or out-of-sync states,  
so that we can document our design-level details for modifications to ensure seamless user setup and digital tool enablement without manual intervention, maintaining data consistency for FBU in Canada. 
 
","Patro, Suman Kumar",Pending PO Review,Integration; Inventory; Solutioning; TECHNICAL SPIKE,\FBU 1C,"Blaszyk, David",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.04,1,Moved out of state In Test,Business,6,"Locate and Document Current State of CRM-CDM Integrations 

 *  Using attached process flow diagram for Contact Management Outgoing Integration (Enable for Digital Tools & Roles Management) as a starting point, develop understanding of how the current CRM enablement flow (e.g., ""Enable for Digital Tools"" button click) triggers webhooks to CDM for user creation, role assignment, and alignment to Sold-To accounts. 
 *  During exploration, start to develop a future state approach that incorporates logic for looping through multiple CRM accounts with shared numbers post-merge, applying division-based filters for Hygiene, and ensuring alignments reference Base Customer Accounts (BCA) when the One Customer flag is set. 
 *  Document where the integrations are located (e.g., CRM plugins/JavaScript for button click, Azure Function App for webhook processing) and which environments are supported (Development, Quality Assurance, Production). 
 

Analyze Current Logic 

 *  Document how the CRM enablement process works today, including required and optional components (e.g., email domain approval checks, E3D eligibility validation, webhook on CDM User create/update, API calls like AlignToAccount for active status, Register API for default Connect Buyer role). 
 *  Understand the required workflows, methods, and transformations for user/role alignment (e.g., checking existing CDM User by email, associating contacts, handling Draft/Active/Error statuses), including any current handling of Nalco Water-specific logic. 
 *  During discovery and research, capture each component, API, and flow (e.g., WebHook on CDM User Customer Role create, AlignByRoleName for required roles) for a shared documentation repository (e.g., wiki or Confluence page), including dependencies on Azure services or CDM endpoints. 
 *  Identify and document Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), including Technical Lead, CRM developer, CDM team, and digital tools specialists. 
 *  Assess current performance impacts on CRM/CDM due to enablement flows, including throughput, error rates, and handling of multiple requests. 
 

Integration Configuration 

 *  Define and locate the existing CRM plugins, JavaScript, and Azure Functions (e.g., for webhook processing) in relevant portals for Development, Quality Assurance, and Production environments. 
 *  Replicate the integration in a development environment, configuring webhooks, API endpoints, and environment variables (e.g., CDM_API_URL, ROLE_DEFAULTS) with sample credentials. 
 *  Add test invocations for key flows (e.g., simulate ""Enable for Digital Tools"" button, webhook trigger for user create API call for role alignment), with working configurations for each. 
 *  Leverage existing DEVELOPMENT instance (ecolabdev.crm.dynamics.com) to prototype integration flow with at least two chained steps: one for eligibility validation and user check (e.g., email domain approval, existing CDM User lookup), and one for creation/alignment (e.g., create CDM User in Draft, assign roles). 
 

Flow Structure 

 *  The enablement flow uses CRM components with logic matching current CDM formats, including required fields: email, account number, role (e.g., Connect Buyer), site ID. 
 *  Optional fields are supported: division-based filters for Hygiene, future extensions like additional roles. 
 *  All logic aligns with no-duplicate rules for shared account numbers and One Customer flag checks, as per existing integration constraints. 
 

Successful Execution 

 *  On valid ""Enable for Digital Tools"" click (e.g., approved domain, eligible site), the validation flow completes with success, triggering webhook to CDM. 
 *  The creation/alignment flow completes, updating CDM with user/role and reflecting in CRM (e.g., active status without errors). 
 

Response Verification 

 *  Integration logs and tests assert execution success, payload validation against expected formats, and ensure no unintended duplicates or overwrites in CDM.  
 

Authentication Handling 

 *  Document integration authentication methods (e.g., API keys for CDM calls, webhook security), succeeding with valid credentials. 
 

Data Validation Errors 

 *  Invalid data (e.g., unapproved email domain, ineligible site) triggers validation logic, rejecting the process with error codes logged. 
 *  Merge or duplicate failures (e.g., shared account numbers without proper loop) handle resolution, logging if unresolvable. 
 

Impact Assessment 

 *  List areas that may be impacted (e.g., plugins, webhooks, Azure Functions, API endpoints for shared accounts/Hygiene filters/One Customer flag). 
 *  Document changes required, including additions to process flow diagrams for integrations. 
 

Duplicate Detection (do not think this is required) 

 *  If duplicates are found (e.g., existing CDM User for shared email/account), processing handles merging or association, preventing overwrites and prompting review if needed. 
 *  Assess how duplicates are handled today; if moving detection to CRM logic, determine if new checks or CDM queries are required.  
 

Testing Approach 

 *  Define ""common"" scenarios to confirm current behavior (e.g., Nalco Water enablement, single account) and future behavior (e.g., Hygiene extension, multiple shared accounts). 
 

Triggers and Scheduling 

 *  Analyze current integration triggers (e.g., button click in CRM, webhook on create/update), execution patterns, dependencies on CDM responses, and any manual overrides. 
 

Monitoring and Alerting 

 *  How are errors handled in this process. Review if there is any integration with monitoring tools (e.g., Azure Application Insights for functions, CRM logs), are there any key metrics (e.g., success rates, error counts), and alerting setups (e.g., notifications for failed alignments) we need to meet. I am assuming this is not a deliverable. 
 

Deliverables 

 *  Technical documentation (memo or wiki) including summary of integration analysis, current logic summary, proposed future logic, pseudocode for modifications, risks (e.g., performance on shared accounts), and test outline. 
 *  Updated prototype integration in development environment that exercises required flows and succeeds (e.g., successful user enablement). 
 *  Effort estimate and prerequisites for implementing changes, including coordination with CRM and CDM teams.

834321,Feature,,,,Data Conversion: Base Customer Account (BCA) Creation and Legacy CRM Account Alignment for One Customer – F&B Canada,,,,,"This feature includes all data conversion activities required to enable the new One Customer account model in CRM for the F&B Canada release. The focus is on creation of Base Customer Accounts (BCAs), correct linkage to existing Sales Skill Account (SSA) records, and handling of edge cases such as duplicate accounts, CDM site merges, and multi-SHIP-TO structures. The objective is to establish clean, consistent parent-child relationships across legacy CRM accounts, without migrating opportunities, service visits, or assets — which already reside correctly on the SSA records.

 
Scope and Activities: 

 *  Base Customer Account (BCA) Creation: 

 *  Generate BCAs from legacy CRM data, grouping existing Sales Skill Accounts (water and hygiene) that belong to the same customer. 
 *  Apply grouping logic based on existing ERP Sold-To/SHIP-TO to ensure correct BCA creation. 
 *  Assign unique identifiers to BCA records and capture legacy identifiers (e.g., old account numbers) for auditability. 
 

 *  Linking of Existing Sales Skill Accounts (SSA) to BCAs: 

 *  Populate the parent account (hierarchy) field on Sales Skill Accounts to reference the newly created BCA. 
 *  Maintain proper H5 hierarchy structure and update CRM’s out-of-box parent-child references accordingly. 
 *  Ensure district field is updated consistently to reflect correct territory alignment post-linkage. 
 

 *  Handling of Duplicate Water/Hygiene Accounts: 

 *  Identify cases where multiple CRM records exist for the same customer (e.g., multiple hygiene or water accounts). 
 *  Trigger controlled merges in CRM to consolidate duplicates before linking to the BCA. 
 *  Ensure merges preserve data integrity and maintain CDM key continuity. 
 

 *  Handling SHIP-TO-to-Sold-To Transformations: 

 *  In scenarios where a legacy SHIP-TO becomes a new Sold-To in EBS, generate a new standalone BCA and SSA pair in CRM. 
 *  Ensure such cases are flagged during data prep and handled as net-new customer records under the One Customer model. 
 

 *  CDM Site Merge Implications: 

 *  Re-align Sales Skill Account records based on prevailing CDM site key when CDM merges have occurred. 
 *  Update CRM to ensure only the survivor site from CDM is referenced; deprecated sites should not remain linked to active accounts. 
 *  Validate all site associations (via context point ID or CDM key) remain intact and correctly point to the merged entity. 
 

 *  Update of Parent Account and Territory Fields: 

 *  Set parent account field on SSA to BCA. 
 *  Ensure district, sales org, and other metadata fields reflect correct post-conversion values. 
 

 *  Optional Contact Deduplication and Re-association: 

 *  Identify duplicate contacts aligned to Sales Skill Accounts (e.g., same person on water and hygiene accounts). 
 *  Where needed, deduplicate and re-link contacts to appropriate SSA or BCA based on access model and user role. 
 *  Retain legacy references or audit metadata where contact merges occur. 
 

 *  Audit and Traceability: 

 *  Maintain mapping tables to capture original account IDs, CDM keys, and BCA/SSA relationships. 
 *  Ensure traceability in the CRM UI (e.g., legacy fields or audit notes) for converted and merged records. 
 

 *  Data Conversion Runs and Staging: 

 *  Execute dry runs and validations in lower environments before final production cutover. 
 *  Support test cycles with simulated CDM merge scenarios and hygiene/water account consolidation. 
 

 

 
Out-of-Scope: 

 *  No migration of opportunities, service visits, or service plans — these will remain linked to the existing Sales Skill Accounts and are unaffected by the new BCA layer. 
 

 
This feature enables a clean foundational data setup required for One Customer go-live by programmatically generating BCAs, linking existing Sales Skill Accounts, consolidating duplicates, and ensuring CRM reflects accurate site and territory alignment per CDM and EBS inputs.

As part of 1C changes NSAP will be merged to EBS. Ship to's a NSAP concept will no longer be supported. 
Ship To's are a NSAP concept. A sold can have many ship to's. As part of 1C if the ship to has an address that Differ's from its parent sold to, the ship to will be promoted to a standalone sold to. As part of the promotion, the old ship to will be deactivated, a new sold to will be created with the new EBS account number. Subsequently a base customer account will be created, a new ship will be created (as a copy of the deactivated ship to, with the exception of the account number being updated to the EBS number and account type = ship to). Child records will be moved to the newly promoted sold to. (see below for diagram).

Business Requirements 

 *  Business will provide a list of sold to accounts that will be flagged for 1C 
 *  A technical spike is to be created that documents... 

 *  The snowflake view to be used to query the related ship to's, and its addresses. And decide if it will be a flat file or consumed directly in snowflake 
 *  technical spike documents logic to compare ship to addresses and promotion rules 
 *  technical spike documents deactivation logic 
 *  technical spike documents step's (ship to promotion, ship to de-activation, which child record will be promoted) 
 *  technical spike documents what attributes will change as part of ship to promotion (EBS account number is there anything else) data mapping document is required. 
 

 

 

 

 

 
Technical Considerations 

 
 *  Build a SSIS package job (as 1 job or broken apart) 

 *  identifies ship to's and its address and compares it to the parent sold to. If the address of the ship to differs from the sold to the ship to is then deactivated, a new sold to account is created and a new ship to is created with the new EBS number 
 *  Child records (Analytical samples, On Demand requests, Billing arrangments, Service visits, will be moved to the new sold to and ship to

866060,Decision,,,,,,Finalization of SHIP-TO Handling Approach During One Customer Data Conversion (Merge vs Recreate),,,"Background / Context:
During the Scrum call on October 8, 2025, the team reviewed two alternative approaches for handling SHIP-TO accounts as part of the One Customer data conversion process. 

 
Currently, the conversion logic has bee defined as shown below:
 

 *  Inactivates SHIP-TOs that are being promoted to their own SOLD-TO records (when SHIP-TO address is not equal to SOLD-TO address). 
 *  Merges multiple versions of SOLD-TOs (Water ? Water and Hygiene ? Hygiene) that belong to the same customer under a single BCA. 
 *  Merges SHIP-TOs having identical addresses under a single SOLD-TO to eliminate redundancy and avoid large-scale re-parenting of related records (Service Visits, Analytical Samples, RTW, etc.). 
 

 
However, some questions were raised about potential impacts on Analytical Sampling, Billing Arrangements, and LIMS integration if SHIP-TOs were merged versus recreated. 

 
Options Discussed: 

 *  Option 1 – Merge Approach 

 *  Deactivate only those SHIP-TOs that are promoted to their own SOLD-TOs. 
 *  Merge remaining SHIP-TOs that share the same address into one record. 
 *  Preserve traceability by storing merged legacy SHIP-TO numbers (comma-separated) in the Legacy Account field on the surviving record. 
 *  This approach ensures all historical transactional links (Service Visits, Analytical Samples, Recurring Services, etc.) remain intact and minimizes re-parenting. 
 

 *  Option 2 – Full Recreation Approach (Alternate Proposal) 

 *  Deactivate all SHIP-TOs, regardless of address similarity. 
 *  Allow the EBS integration (ADF pipeline) to create brand-new SHIP-TOs for all impacted SOLD-TOs. 
 *  Re-parent every related record (Service Visits, Analytical Samples) from old SHIP-TOs to the newly created SHIP-TOs. 
 *  Ensures a clean slate but introduces significant data-migration effort and operational risk due to the re-parenting of high-volume records. 
 

 

 
Decision / Preliminary Direction: 
After discussion, Tom Lanz and the delivery team agreed that the Merge Approach is the preferred path forward, as it: 

 *  Reduces complexity and data-relinking effort. 
 *  Preserves history for Service Visits and Analytical Samples. 
 *  Minimizes the number of new SHIP-TO records created. 
 *  Avoids re-parenting hundreds of related transactional records. 
 

 
However, Tom Lanz will confirm with the LIMS Team regarding potential impacts to in-flight samples during the first few days post-cutover, when merged SHIP-TOs may replace previously referenced SHIP-TO IDs. 
Pending that confirmation, this approach will be finalized.
 

 
Pending Action / Next Step: 

 *  Action: Tom Lanz to confirm with the LIMS Team if merging SHIP-TOs could affect active/in-flight samples post-cutover. 
 *  Due Date: October 10, 2025 
 *  Responsible: Tom Lanz. 
 

 

 
Rationale for the Option 1: 

 *  Maintains historical integrity of Analytical Samples and Field Service records. 
 *  Avoids massive re-parenting and regression re-testing effort. 
 *  Aligns with CRM merge functionality already used for SOLD-TO consolidation. 
 *  Keeps legacy traceability through legacy account field references. 
 *  Integration re-runs and analytical reporting remain less impacted. 
 

 
Decision Status: 

 *  Pending Final Confirmation from LIMS Team (Tom Lanz to validate) 
 *  Once confirmed, update this item to Decision Status = Finalized and reference in related user stories for SHIP-TO Merge and Deactivation logic.

This story covers:
 

 *  SHIPTO-1 (Hygiene-only in EBS) — when a Hygiene Sold-To exists in EBS and no Water Sold-To exists in NSAP. This new Ship to will be created to Integration. No Data Conversion effort needed here  
 *  Water-only in NSAP, with a single Ship-To — when a Water Sold-To exists in NSAP with only one linked Ship-To, and no Hygiene Sold-To exists in EBS. 
 

 
The objective is to: 

 *  Ensure the Hygiene scenario creates the missing Ship-To record and establishes its link. 
 *  Ensure the Water scenario correctly updates and retains the existing single Ship-To record without creating duplicates. 
 *  Maintain consistent Sales Skill tagging, relationships, and ERP number alignment.

864700,User Story,,,,,,"DC: Update Account Number, Sales Skill and Sold TO Reference on NSAP Ship-To Accounts That Convert to New EBS Sold-Tos",,,"As a CRM Data Conversion Analyst, I need to identify all NSAP Ship-To accounts that are being promoted to their own Sold-Tos in EBS, unparent them from their existing Sold-To relationship, and update the Account number on these Unparented Ship To's to match the EBS account number provided by the business and update the sales skill to Water flag them as Ship-To merge candidates, so that these records can have an updated Sold To Lookup post creation of the new Sold To's using the targeted EBS ADF Sold To Pipeline run  do not get merged during the Sold-To merge process but will later the ADF Ship To Integration would update the Sold To reference on the Ship To record as the number on this ship to record will match the EBS number be included in the Ship-To merge process that consolidates them with their newly created EBS Ship-To records.
 
 
 
 

 
Background and Rationale 

 *  In NSAP, one Sold-To can have multiple Ship-To records with distinct addresses. 
 *  In EBS, each unique address becomes its own Sold-To, with a new Ship-To linked under it. 
 *  Previously, these NSAP Ship-Tos were deactivated before the Sold-To merge to avoid merging them into the wrong surviving Sold-To. 
 *  Deactivation led to reparenting complexity for Service Visits, Recurring Services, ASA records, etc. 
 *  The new approach avoids that by: 

 *  Keeping NSAP Ship-Tos active. 
 *  Unparenting them (removing their Sold-To reference) before Sold-To merges occur.  
 *  Updating the Account number  on this Unparented Ship To to match the new EBS number provided by the Business 
 *  Updating the Sales Skill field on this unparent Ship To record to Water 
 *  Update the Sold To Reference to the new Sold To that got created (Also present in the EBSAccountId field in the staging table) 
 *  Flagging them in the staging/conversion table as “Ship-To Merge Candidates” so the downstream Ship-To merge process can merge them with their new EBS Ship-To linked to the new EBS Sold-To.  
 

 *  The identification of such NSAP Ship-Tos will be derived from the business-provided migration spreadsheet, which includes: 

 *  Legacy Source 
 *  Legacy Sold-To and Ship-To Numbers and Addresses 
 *  Survivor Account 
 *  EBS Sold-To Number and EBS Ship-To Number 
 

 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Use the business-provided migration spreadsheet to identify all NSAP Ship-Tos that are mapped to new Sold-Tos in EBS based on business provided list. 
 *  For each qualifying Ship-To: 

 *  Keep the record active (no deactivation). 
 *  Remove the Sold-To reference (unparent the record).  
 *  Updating the Account number  on this Unparented Ship To to match the new EBS number provided by the Business
 
 *  Update the Sales Skill field to Water on this Unparented Ship To. 
 *  Update the Sold To Reference to the ship to new Sold To that got created (Also present in the EBSAccountId field in the staging table)
 
 *  Flag the record in the conversion table as a Ship-To Merge Candidate (Flag_SHP2_Merge = Yes).  
 *  Ensure the unparented Ship-To is excluded from Sold-To merge logic.  
 *  Ensure it will be included in the downstream Ship-To merge logic (separate story). 
 *  Preserve all child data (Service Plans, Assets, Service Visits, Opportunities, Analytical Sampling) intact. 
 *  Capture audit details: Ship-To ID, old Sold-To ID, merge flag status, and target EBS Sold-To/Ship-To references.  
 

 *  Validate record counts against business input to ensure all targeted Ship-Tos are flagged correctly.

Business Acceptance Criteria
 
 
 
 
 

 *  Scenario 1 – Unparent and Flag NSAP SHIP-TOs getting converted to new Sold To's in EBS for Ship To Merge 

 *  Given a NSAP Ship-To record is identified in the business spreadsheet as being promoted to a new Sold-To in EBS 
 *  When the data conversion flagging process runs 
 *  Then the record must be unparented from its current Sold-To, remain active, and be flagged as a Ship-To merge candidate in the staging table.
 
 *  And the Ship To Account Number on this record gets updated to the new EBS Account number provided by the business in the EBS account Number column in the Data Spreadsheet 
 *  And the Sales Skill on this record gets updated to Water 
 *  And the Sold To reference gets updated on this record using the new EBS Sold TO account created (Value present in the EBSAccountid field in the staging table) 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – validate that the Sold TO Merge should exclude unparented Ship To's (No development needed in this story but this needs to be validated) 

 *  Given a Ship-To record is flagged for Ship-To merge inclusion 
 *  When the Sold-To merge package executes 
 *  Then that Ship-To must remain excluded from the Sold-To merge activity due to its unparented state.
 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Preserve SHIP-TOs Sharing SOLD-TO Address 

 *  Given a SHIP-TO shares the same address as its SOLD-TO, 
 *  When the script executes, 
 *  Then it remains Active and linked to its parent SOLD-TO. 
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Validation Report 

 *  Given the process is complete, 
 *  When a summary extract is produced, 
 *  Then the report lists each unparented SHIP-TO, legacy source, and reason for audit. 
 *  and the report must list each flagged NSAP Ship-To with its old Sold-To reference, flag status, and target EBS Sold-To and EBS Ship-To mappings.
 
 

 

 
Dependencies 

 *  Business-provided migration spreadsheet mapping NSAP Ship-Tos to EBS Sold-To/Ship-To records. 
 *  EBS ADF Sold To Pipeline is executed for these accounts that got created as new sold to's in CRM 
 *  Completion of Sold TO creation for the selected account based on the above step. 
 *  The Staging table is updated to reflect the latest values in the EBSAccountID and EBSSoldToInCRM columns 
 *  “Sold-To Merge” and “Ship-To Merge” stories must execute sequentially, with this step completed before Sold-To merges begin. 
 *  The “Ship-To Merge Logic” story must consume the Flag_SHP2_Merge = Yes marker to execute the actual merges later.

865269,User Story,,,,,,DC: Reparent Dependent Records When SHIP-TOs Are Promoted to New SOLD-TOs,,,"As a data conversion analyst,
I want to reparent all dependent records (Service Visits, Recurring Services, Analytical Samples) that reference SHIP-TOs promoted to their own SOLD-TOs,
 
so that all service-related and analytical data continues to reference the correct, newly created SOLD-TO and SHIP-TO records without data loss or orphaned relationships.
 

 
Background and Rationale 

 *  Under the One Customer model, SHIP-TOs with unique addresses in NSAP are being promoted to standalone SOLD-TOs in EBS. 
 *  This change impacts all downstream child records that currently reference the legacy SHIP-TO and its parent SOLD-TO. 
 *  In the legacy NSAP design: 

 *  Each SOLD-TO could have multiple SHIP-TOs, some sharing the same address and others representing distinct physical sites. 
 *  Service Visits and Recurring Services records in CRM reference both the SOLD-TO (Account) and the SHIP-TO. 
 *  Analytical Samples (ASA) also reference these same account structures. 
 

 *  In EBS, every unique site address becomes its own SOLD-TO, and the SHIP-TO record retains the same number as the SOLD-TO. 
 *  Therefore, all Service Visits, Recurring Services, and Analytical Samples tied to a SHIP-TO that is promoted to its own SOLD-TO must have their parent relationships updated accordingly.

Scope 
Applies only to records where: 

 *  Service Performed By = Field Services Team (because these require both SOLD-TO and SHIP-TO references). 
 *  District-team records (which rely on SOLD-TO + Site) remain unchanged. 
 *  Entities Impacted 

 *  Service Visits 
 *  Recurring Services 
 *  Tank Orders 
 *  Analytical Samples

 *  Scenario 1 – Identify Impacted Records 

 *  Given the SHIP-TOs identified in the data-conversion staging table  
 *  When a SHIP-TO has been promoted to a new SOLD-TO and new SHIP-TO record exists with an EBS number, 
 *  Then the system must query all Service Visits, Recurring Services, Tank Orders and Analytical Samples linked to that SHIP-TO GUID.

 *  Given a Service Visit record where Service Performed By = Field Services Team,

 *  Given a Service Visit record where Service Performed By = District Team,  
 *  When the reparenting script runs,  
 *  Then no changes should be made because these records do not use SHIP-TO relationships.  
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Reparent Recurring Services (Performed by Field Services Team) 

 *  Given a Recurring Service record with references to both SOLD-TO and SHIP-TO, 
 *  When the associated SHIP-TO  identified above, 
 *  Then update the SOLD-TO and SHIP-TO fields to the new records matching the new EBS numbers. 
 

 *  Scenario 5 – Reparent Analytical Samples (ASA) 

 *  Given an Analytical Sample record linked to a deactivated SHIP-TO, 
 *  When the reparenting logic executes, 
 *  Then the SOLD-TO and SHIP-TO references must be updated to the new account records. 
 

 *  Scenario 6 – Validation and Audit Report 

 *  Given all updates are complete, 
 *  When the audit report is generated, 
 *  Then it must include: 

 *  Legacy SOLD-TO and SHIP-TO numbers, 
 *  New SOLD-TO and SHIP-TO numbers, 
 *  Service Visit / Recurring Service / ASA record IDs, 
 *  Updated status and timestamp. 
 

 

 

 

 
Dependencies: 

 *  Completion of the SHIP-TO Updates user story. 
 *  Availability of business-provided mapping file with new EBS SOLD-TO and SHIP-TO numbers. 
 *  SOLD-TO merge and SHIP-TO creation logic already executed. 
 *  Validation of the new SOLD-TO and SHIP-TO records in CRM before reparenting.

864701,User Story,,,,,,DC: Merge Duplicate SHIP-TOs (Same Address) Linked to the Same SOLD-TO,,,"3As a data conversion analyst,
 
I want to merge duplicate SHIP-TO records that share the same SOLD-TO and identical address attributes,
 
so that each SOLD-TO has a single active SHIP-TO and child records (such as Assets, Service Visits, and SOWs) remain accurately linked.
 

 
Background and Rationale 

 *  After the promotion and deactivation of eligible SHIP-TOs is completed and the SOLD-TO merges have been executed, some SOLD-TO accounts may still contain multiple active SHIP-TO records with identical addresses. 
 *  This is a common artifact of the legacy NSAP structure, where the same site was represented by multiple SHIP-TO records. 
 *  The goal of this story is to develop a data conversion package that identifies such duplicates and merges them into a single surviving SHIP-TO per SOLD-TO. 
 *  The package must use CRM’s native merge capabilities to re-parent child records (including Service Visits, Assets, SOWs, and Activities) to the surviving SHIP-TO. 
 *  It must not interfere with integration pipelines or create new records—only cleanse existing data for structural integrity before cutover.

 *  Scenario 1 – Identify Duplicate SHIP-TOs 

 *  Given multiple SHIP-TOs exist under the same SOLD-TO, post the merging of Multiple Sold To's 
 *  Then extract the list of all Ship To's linked with the Sold To's , 
 *  Then they are queued for merge consolidation. 
 *  and the legacy account number on the surviving Ship To should indicate the list of all the Ship Numbers (Pipe | Separated) that would merged 
 *  The Ship To record that has the same account number as that of the Sold To and has sales skill value populated on it will be the Survivor Ship To and all other Ship To linked to that Sold TO should be merged into the surviving Ship To 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – Perform Merge 

 *  Given the Merged Ship To's are flagged, 
 *  When the merge script executes, 
 *  Then one SHIP-TO is retained as the survivor and all child records (Field Service Service Visits, Recurring Services, etc.) are re-parented without data loss. 
 *  and the Legacy number field on the surviving record should be updated to the Pipe Separated values derived in Scenario 1 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Retain Survivor Attributes 

 *  Given the merge completes, 
 *  When the survivor is finalized, 
 *  Then it must retain the correct EBS Account Number, Sales Skill, and SOLD-TO relationship. 
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Exception Handling 

 *  Given a merge fails due to timeout or record lock, 
 *  When the exception is caught, 
 *  Then details are logged with SHIP-TO number, SOLD-TO number, and status for reprocessing. 
 

 

 
Dependencies 

 *  Completion of SOLD-TO merge stories. 
 *  Completion of the SHIP-TO deactivation story . 
 *  Validated business mapping spreadsheet with address alignment for EBS and NSAP.

863567,User Story,,,,,,DC: Execute SHIP-TO Merge and Creation for Surviving Hygiene (EBS) and Water (NSAP) SOLD_TO Accounts — Scenarios SHIPTO-2 through SHIPTO-6,,,"As a Data Conversion Analyst,
 
I need to design and execute a SHIP-TO creation and merge process that harmonizes how SHIP-TOs are handled for Hygiene (EBS) and Water (NSAP) accounts under the One Customer model,
 
so that after all SOLD_TO merges and Base Customer Account (BCA) linkages are complete, each customer has a single, clean, and address-aligned representation of SHIP-TOs in CRM — one per SalesSkill (Water / Hygiene) — preserving address integrity and historical continuity.
 

 
Business Context  
In the legacy systems: 

 *  NSAP (Water) supports a one-to-many relationship between SOLD_TO and SHIP-TO, allowing multiple SHIP-TOs with different delivery addresses per customer. 
 *  EBS (Hygiene) does not have separate SHIP-TOs. Each SOLD_TO represents both sold-to and ship-to functions in one record.  
 

 
Under the Ecolab One Customer transformation, CRM will be pulling in EBS SHIP-TOs for Hygiene customers to maintain parity with Water’s data model, ensuring both divisions can participate uniformly in downstream apps (Hub, Service Plan Builder, ASA, etc.). 
However, in the new EBS model, each SHIP-TO will share the same account number as its parent SOLD_TO, meaning effectively a 1:1 relationship between SOLD_TO and SHIP-TO in EBS (in most cases deviated Ship To's scenarios can result in more than one Ship To linked to an EBS Sold TO), versus a 1:N in NSAP.
 

 
Therefore, the SHIP-TO harmonization process must:
 

 *  Create new SHIP-TO records for Hygiene (EBS) where none exist today. 
 *  Merge or deactivate redundant SHIP-TOs for Water (NSAP) where multiple exist for the same address or where some are being promoted to standalone SOLD_TOs. 
 *  Ensure every surviving SOLD_TO — whether Hygiene or Water — has exactly one active SHIP-TO per SalesSkill, with the correct EBS number, address, and relationships. 
 *  Execute after SOLD_TO merges and BCA linkages are complete, since only the surviving SOLD_TOs should be referenced for final SHIP-TO relationships. 
 

 
This ensures CRM and EBS remain in sync during and after migration, preventing duplicate site visibility and ensuring downstream applications (like Hub, ASA, Service Visits, etc.) continue to function seamlessly. 

 
Process Flow Overview 

 *  Pre-requisite Dependencies: 

 *  All SOLD_TO merges (e.g., SOLD_TO-2, SOLD_TO-4, SOLD_TO-5) have been executed and survivors finalized. 
 *  BCA creation and linkage completed for each customer. 
 *  NSAP SHIP-TOs being promoted to standalone EBS SOLD_TOs have been identified and deactivated. 
 *  Address verification completed for surviving SOLD_TOs. 
 

 *  SHIP-TO Processing Steps: 

 *  Identify scenario type (SHIPTO-2 ? SHIPTO-6) using legacy source (EBS/NSAP) and SalesSkill. 
 *  For Hygiene (EBS) accounts ? create missing SHIP-TOs. 
 *  For Water (NSAP) accounts ? merge or deactivate existing SHIP-TOs according to promotion logic. 
 *  Update surviving SHIP-TO records with EBS account number and correct SalesSkill. 
 *  Re-establish SOLD_TO–SHIP_TO relationships based on new structure. 
 

 *  Outcome: 

 *  One active SHIP-TO per SalesSkill per SOLD_TO. 
 *  Address alignment preserved. 
 *  Downstream systems reference a unified structure with no orphaned or duplicate records.

 *  And no Water counterpart exists in NSAP,  
 *  When the SHIP-TO creation process runs,  
 *  Then:  

 *  Create one new SHIP-TO under the surviving EBS SOLD_TO.  
 *  SHIP-TO number = EBS SOLD_TO number.  
 *  SalesSkill = Hygiene.  
 *  Establish SOLD_TO ? SHIP-TO relationship.  
 *  No SHIP-TO deactivation logic applies.  
 

 

 *  Scenario SHIPTO-3 — One Hygiene (EBS) SOLD_TO, One Water (NSAP) SOLD_TO (With One Ship To) 

 *  Given one Hygiene SOLD_TO exists in EBS and one Water SOLD_TO exists in NSAP for the same customer, 
 *  And the SOLD_TO merge process has been executed and both are linked to the same BCA, 
 *  When the SHIP-TO process runs, 
 *  Then: 

 *  Create one Hygiene SHIP-TO under the EBS SOLD_TO (SalesSkill = Hygiene).

 *  Update the existing Water SHIP-TO number to the same EBS mapping number. 
 *  Maintain relationship of both SHIP-TOs to their respective SOLD_TOs. 
 *  No SHIP-TO merge or deactivation is required. 
 

 

 *  Scenario SHIPTO-4 — Multiple Hygiene (EBS) SOLD_TO, One Water (NSAP) SOLD_TO (With One Ship To) 

 *  Given multiple Hygiene SOLD_TOs exist in EBS and one Water SOLD_TO exists in NSAP, 
 *  And the multiple Hygiene SOLD_TOs have already been merged into a single survivor, 
 *  When the SHIP-TO process runs, 
 *  Then: 

 *  Create one Hygiene SHIP-TO for the surviving EBS SOLD_TO (SalesSkill = Hygiene, number = EBS SOLD_TO number). 
 *  For the single Water SOLD_TO having one SHIP-TO, update that SHIP-TO number to EBS mapping number and set SalesSkill = Water. 
 *  Ensure both SHIP-TOs link to their respective SOLD_TOs and BCA. 
 *  No merge or deactivation needed. 
 

 

 *  Scenario SHIPTO-5 — One Hygiene (EBS) SOLD_TO, Multiple Water (NSAP) SOLD_TOs 

 *  Given one EBS Hygiene SOLD_TO and multiple NSAP Water SOLD_TOs exist for the same customer, 
 *  And the Water SOLD_TOs have been merged into a single surviving Water SOLD_TO, 
 *  And that Water SOLD_TO has multiple SHIP-TOs (some to be promoted to new SOLD_TOs because of address differences),

 *  Update SHIP-TO number = EBS mapping number. 
 *  Set SalesSkill = Water. 
 *  Maintain link with the same BCA as the EBS Hygiene SOLD_TO. 
 

 

 *  Scenario SHIPTO-6 — Multiple Hygiene (EBS) SOLD_TOs, Multiple Water (NSAP) SOLD_TOs 

 *  Given multiple Hygiene SOLD_TOs in EBS and multiple Water SOLD_TOs in NSAP exist for the same customer,

 *  Update all SHIP-TO numbers = final EBS mapping numbers. 
 *  Ensure relationship consistency between BCA, SOLD_TOs, and SHIP-TOs. 
 

 

 


 
 

Key Business Rules

 *  Deactivation applies only to Water (NSAP) SHIP-TOs with distinct addresses promoted to new SOLD_TOs. 
 *  Creation applies only to Hygiene (EBS) where no SHIP-TO exists today in CRM. 
 *  Ship To Merge executes only after SOLD_TO merge and BCA linkage. 
 *  Each customer has at most two active SHIP-TOs (one per SalesSkill). 
 *  All legacy references must remain traceable for audit and reporting.

As a CRM Technical Architect, I need to perform a technical spike to analyze and define the approach for handling Ship To conversions and deactivations during the One Customer data migration, based on business-provided data and rules. This includes:

 *  Using the business-supplied lists of Ship Tos that must be converted to Sold Tos or deactivated. 
 *  Ensuring CRM can correctly process new Sold To creations and Ship To deactivations in alignment with integration pipelines. 
 *  Documenting how child tables/entities (opportunities, service visits, RTWs, TVDs, billing arrangements, contacts, recurring services, etc.) will be moved, duplicated, or retained when Ship To data transitions occur. 
 *  Confirming how integration pipelines (ADF) will bring in new Ship To/Sold To records from EBS, and what fallback processes (SSIS/manual scripts) are needed. 
 *  Producing a consolidated document that captures all Ship To scenarios (conversion, deactivation, and related impacts), to guide downstream development and cutover readiness. 
 

 

We need to finalize a staging table approach so that we can report on what records were move and counts to the business. This design needs to cover service visits, recurring service visits, billing arrangements, on demand requests, and analytical samples

848847,User Story,,,,,,DC - Merge Ship To Accounts,,," 
As a data conversion analyst,
I need to build a merge package that reads flagged records from the data conversion table (using survivor account mapping and legacy source details) and merges duplicate Water and Hygiene ship to accounts for the same customer into their respective survivor accounts,
 
so that CRM and downstream systems maintain a single accurate version of each account while preserving child relationships and data integrity.
 

 
Background and Rationale: 
During the One Customer (1C) implementation, Water (NSAP) and Hygiene (EBS) systems each contain duplicate or versioned Ship-To accounts. These must be merged within their respective legacy sources prior to final BCA linkage. 

 
The merge package will:
 

 *  Use a data conversion control table that lists each account, its country, legacy source, legacy Sold-To or Ship-To numbers, survivor account ID, and target EBS account number. 
 *  Group and merge accounts based on survivor account and legacy source (EBS or NSAP). 
 *  Automatically migrate child records (Opportunities, TVD Programs, RTW, etc.) to the survivor account. 
 *  Flag records for exception handling and produce reconciliation reports. 
 

 
This ensures that for each ERP source, one Water account and one Hygiene account survive per customer — ready for BCA creation. 

 
","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,Data Migration,\FBU 1C\Data,"Nguyen, Chau",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,0," 
Business Acceptance Criteria:
 
 

 *  Scenario 1: Hygiene Accounts Ship To Creation after Sold To merge 

 *  Given a ship to is not found in CRM but is listed as an account in EBS 
 *  When the merge package runs 
 *  A ship to will be created and linked to the sold to 
 

 *  Scenario 2: Water Accounts Ship to Merge after sold to merge

844849,Requirement,,,,,SalesOrg Harmonization and Data Conversion for One Customer – Transition from 2001 to CA10,,,,"Business Objective:
To enable a unified product, sales, and reporting experience across Water and Hygiene divisions under the One Customer – Canada model by standardizing and harmonizing SalesOrg (Sales Organization) values. 
The goal is to transition all applicable Water accounts and related transactional data from SalesOrg 2001 to the unified Hygiene SalesOrg CA10, ensuring seamless continuity in product filtering, opportunity management, and downstream reporting once all divisions operate under the single SalesOrg CA10.
 

 
Business Requirement: 

 *  SalesOrg Alignment: 

 *  All active Water accounts currently under SalesOrg 2001 must be updated to the unified SalesOrg CA10. 
 *  This update must cascade to all dependent entities (Opportunities, RTW, Lost Business, Sales Activities, and Tank Orders) to maintain alignment between Account-level and record-level SalesOrg values. 
 

 *  Product–SalesOrg Synchronization: 

 *  Products available today under SalesOrg 2001 (Water) must be made available under CA10 (Hygiene) using their equivalent EBS Product Numbers provided by the business. 
 *  A new Product–SalesOrg linkage should be created for CA10 in CRM, ensuring the right product filtering logic works for Opportunities, RTW, and Lost Business entries post-migration. 
 

 *  Data Consistency Across Related Entities: 

 *  All transactional records referencing Water accounts must be updated to reflect the correct SalesOrg (CA10) to prevent discrepancies in filtering, validation, and reporting logic. 
 

 

 

 
Deliverables:
 

 *  Updated SalesOrg values across all relevant CRM entities for Water accounts migrated to CA10. 
 *  New Product–SalesOrg mappings created for CA10 using EBS Product Numbers (per business-provided mapping file). 
 *  Validation and Audit Reports capturing: 

 *  Total records processed per entity. 
 *  Old vs. New SalesOrg values. 
 *  Missing or skipped records (e.g., missing EBS mappings). 
 

 *  Configuration validation confirming Opportunities, RTW, and Lost Business entities correctly filter products based on CA10 SalesOrg. 
 *  Documentation update outlining SalesOrg dependency tables, field names, and synchronization logic for long-term maintenance.

881561,User Story,,,,,,Load and Validate Product–Sales Org Mapping for New EBS Products (Canada Go-Live),,,"As a data conversion analyst supporting the One Customer Canada Go-Live
I want to validate and create new product records and sales org mappings in CRM using the EBS product list shared by business
 
So that all new EBS products are correctly represented in CRM and linked to the proper sales orgs (CA10 for Hygiene, 2001 for Water) before conversion.
 

 
Business Context / Rationale 

 *  The business provided a validated Excel sheet listing legacy NSAP products and their corresponding new EBS product numbers and names. 
 *  Canada’s F&B (1C) model uses two key Sales Orgs: 

 *  CA10 ? Hygiene 
 *  2001 ? Water 
 

 *  These EBS products must be created and mapped to the correct sales orgs before cutover to ensure that transactions, price lists, and service templates reference valid CRM products. 
 *  CRM must also maintain backward traceability — each new EBS product should link to its corresponding NSAP product using an Existing Product Lookup field. 
 *  This story focuses on data validation and creation within CRM (not integration logic). 
 *  Separate stories will handle ongoing product–sales org mapping logic and data sync validation. 
 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Load the business-provided Excel data into a staging table (ProductConversion_Staging). 
 *  Filter and process only the rows where: 

 *  Sales Org = 2001 (Water) 
 *  Scope = ‘F&B – In Scope’ 
 *  New EBS Product Number is not blank, zero, or invalid (#N/A, Delayed, etc.). 
 

 *  Retrieve distinct New EBS Product Numbers from this filtered data. 
 *  For each EBS product number: 

 *  Check if the product already exists in CRM. 
 *  If not, create a new product record in CRM with attributes from the Excel sheet (Name, Product Number, Description, etc., Legacy product Number). 
 *  If the product already exists, update the staging table to mark the record as “Exists in CRM.” 
 

 *  For each newly created or existing product, populate the Existing Product Lookup field to reference the NSAP product. 
 *  Ensure proper Product–Sales Org Mapping is established: 

 *  CA10 for Hygiene 
 *  2001 for Water 
 

 *  Log results in the staging table for traceability (Created, Updated, Exists). 
 *  These steps must be completed before cutover so that pricing and product associations work seamlessly during go-live. 
 

 

","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,,\FBU 1C\Data,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,2,"Business Acceptance Criteria: 

 *  Validate source product list 

 *  Given the business has provided the EBS Product Excel sheet 
 *  When the data is loaded into the staging table 
 *  Then the system must validate all entries where Sales Org = 2001 and Scope = F&B – In Scope 
 *  And exclude records with invalid or missing new EBS product numbers. 
 

 *  Identify distinct EBS products 

 *  Given the staging table contains valid product data 
 *  When the distinct New EBS Product Numbers are retrieved 
 *  Then the system must prepare a list of unique EBS products for validation and creation. 
 

 *  Check for existing products in CRM 

 *  Given a list of EBS Product Numbers from staging 
 *  When the CRM product table is queried 
 *  Then any matching products must be marked as “Exists in CRM” in the staging table 
 *  And must not be recreated. 
 *  and the Legacy product Number lookup should be updated on this existing record to match the NSAP product ID 
 

 *  Create new EBS products if not found 

 *  Given an EBS product does not exist in CRM 
 *  When the process executes 
 *  Then the product must be created in CRM with all key attributes from the Excel source 
 *  And the Existing Product Lookup field must reference the NSAP legacy product. 
 

 *  Log results and validation summary 

 *  Given all products are processed 
 *  When the conversion process completes 
 *  Then the staging table must record Created / Exists / Updated statuses for each product 
 *  And a summary report must display total counts by status and success percentage. 
 

 *  No duplicate products 

 *  Given product creation is complete 
 *  When CRM is validated post-load 
 *  Then no duplicate product numbers must exist across NSAP and EBS product tables. 
 

 

The List of Product Sales Org Mapping shared by Business is provided below 
 
ProductSalesOrg.xlsx
 

 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Create a new staging table in the data conversion schema to store and process the business-provided product mapping file. 

 *  Proposed table name: NSAP_EBS_Product_SalesOrg_Mapping 
 

 *  Columns to include: 

 *  All columns from the business spreadsheet (e.g., Existing Product Name, Existing Product Number, Scope, Sales Org, Origin, New EBS Product Name, New EBS Product Number, Product Status). 
 

 *  Derived / additional columns: 

 *  Existing_Product_GUID ? stores the GUID of the NSAP (legacy) product fetched from CRM Product table. 
 *  New_EBS_Product_GUID ? stores the GUID of the newly created or existing EBS product in CRM Product table. 
 *  Processing_Status ? flags each record as CREATE_NEW, UPDATE_EXISTING, or SKIP. 
 *  Execution_Status ? logs final outcome: SUCCESS, FAILURE, or VALIDATION_ERROR. 
 *  Execution_Timestamp ? date/time when the record was last processed. 
 *  Error_Message ? short description of any exception or validation issue (nullable). 
 

 *  Processing logic: 

 *  Load the business Excel data into this table (one-time load). 
 *  For each record: 
 *  Use the Existing Product Number to find its CRM product GUID; populate Existing_Product_GUID. 
 *  Check if the New EBS Product Number already exists in CRM. 
 *  If exists, populate New_EBS_Product_GUID, mark Processing_Status = UPDATE_EXISTING. 
 *  If not exists, create the product in CRM, capture the GUID, mark Processing_Status = CREATE_NEW. 
 

 *  Update Execution_Status to SUCCESS upon completion. 

 *  If an error occurs (e.g., product creation failure, invalid lookup, or missing key field): 
 *  Log details in the generic data conversion error log table. 
 *  Update Execution_Status = FAILURE and record the error message in the staging table. 
 

 *  Post-processing: 

 *  Verify counts between source Excel and staging table (total, created, updated). 
 *  Generate validation output showing: 
 *  Total records processed 
 *  Successfully created 
 *  Updated 
 *  Failed (with reasons)

865831,User Story,,,,,,"DC: Update SalesOrg to CA10 for Opportunities, RTW, Lost Business, Sales Activities, and Tank Orders Linked to Water Accounts Migrating Under CA10",,,"As a data conversion analyst,
 
 
 
 
I want to update the SalesOrg field to CA10 across all key CRM entities linked to Water accounts that are transitioning to CA10 under the One Customer model,
 
so that product filtering, sales logic, and reporting continue to function correctly for all related records post-migration.
 

 
Background and Rationale: 

 *  Under the One Customer – R1 Canada initiative, all Water accounts associated with legacy SalesOrg 2001 are being updated to the unified SalesOrg CA10 (Hygiene). 
 *  This alignment must be cascaded to all related CRM entities that reference the SalesOrg field directly or indirectly. 
 *  In CRM, the SalesOrg value drives Product filtering – determining which products appear on Opportunities, RTW, and Lost Business records. 
 *  Because these entities depend on the parent Account’s SalesOrg, when Accounts move from 2001 to CA10, all associated child records must also reflect CA10. 
 *  The following related entities are in scope for this update: 

 *  Opportunities (ecl_accountsalesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp) 
 *  Opportunity Products (ecl_productsalesorgid, ProductSalesOrg LoopUp; ecl_opptysalesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp) 
 *  Retain-to-Win (RTW) records (ecl_productsalesorgid, ProductSalesOrg LoopUp) 
 *  RTW Products (field: ecl_productsalesorgid)  
 *  Lost Business records (ecl_salesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp) 
 *  Lost Business Products (ecl_productsalesorgid, ProductSalesOrg LoopUp) 
 *  Sales Activities SalesOrg (ecl_salesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp) and Product SalesOrg (ecl_productsalesorgid, ProductSalesOrg LoopUp)  
 *  Tank Orders (ecl_salesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp)  
 *  Tank Order Detail Product SalesOrg (ecl_productsalesorgid, ProductSalesOrg LoopUp) and Account SalesOrg (ecl_opptysalesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp)
 
 

 *  This change ensures the unified SalesOrg (CA10) is consistently represented across all data layers, maintaining integrity in product selection, reporting, and downstream integrations.

 *  Given all Water accounts currently linked with SalesOrg 2001, 
 *  When those accounts are flagged for migration to CA10, 
 *  Then a list of impacted Account IDs must be compiled for use across dependent entity updates. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – Update Related Opportunities and Products 

 *  Given opportunities linked to those migrated accounts, 
 *  When the data conversion executes, 
 *  Then the Opportunity SalesOrg (ecl_accountsalesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp) field must be updated from 2001 ? CA10. 
 *  And the Opportunity Product SalesOrg (ecl_productsalesorgid, ProductSalesOrg LoopUp; ecl_opptysalesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp) must be updated to CA10 as well.

 *  Then Lost Business SalesOrg (ecl_salesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp) and Product SalesOrg (ecl_productsalesorgid, ProductSalesOrg LoopUp) fields must be updated to CA10. 

 *  Product SalesOrg should be linked to the equivalent EBS Product Sales org Record  
 

 

 *  Scenario 5 – Update Sales Activities 

 *  Given Sales Activity records referencing migrated accounts, 
 *  When the process runs, 
 *  Then the SalesOrg (ecl_salesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp) and Product SalesOrg (ecl_productsalesorgid, ProductSalesOrg LoopUp) field must be updated to CA10. 

 *  Product SalesOrg should be linked to the equivalent EBS Product Sales org Record  
 

 

 *  Scenario 6 – Update Tank Orders and Tank Order Detail  

 *  Given Tank Order records linked to the same accounts,  
 *  When the conversion runs,  
 *  Then the SalesOrg field (ecl_salesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp) on Tank Orders must be updated to CA10.  
 *  And the Tank Order Detail Product SalesOrg (ecl_productsalesorgid, ProductSalesOrg LoopUp) and Account SalesOrg (ecl_opptysalesorgid, SalesOrg LookUp) must be updated to CA10 as well.  

 *  Product SalesOrg should be linked to the equivalent EBS Product Sales org Record   
 

 

 *  Scenario 7 – Validation and Audit Logging 

 *  Given all entity updates are complete, 
 *  When validation is performed, 
 *  Then every record associated with migrated accounts must show SalesOrg = CA10. 
 *  all the updates must be audited, so that I can see the Old Value and the new value from the audit logs

I want product and sales org lookups updated to CA10 EBS equivalents for all records linked to 1C accounts,
 
so that users transact only on valid CA10 products and sales orgs, and downstream EBS and 1C integrations remain consistent.
 

 
Business Context & Background
 

 *  As part of the One Customer (1C) initiative, Water (NSAP) accounts are being aligned and linked with Hygiene accounts under the CA10 sales organization. 
 *  To support this alignment, all downstream transactional records associated with 1C accounts must: 

 *  Reference CA10 (EBS) products, not legacy NSAP products 
 *  Reference CA10 Sales Org, not legacy sales orgs 
 

 *  Today, several CRM tables for 1C records still reference: 

 *  NSAP product records 
 *  Non-CA10 sales org values 
 

 *  If left unchanged: 

 *  Users may continue to see and transact on incorrect products 
 *  Product selection may not align with EBS 
 *  1C migration and downstream integrations will be impacted 
 

 *  This user story ensures that all in-scope transactional records tied to 1C accounts are normalized to CA10 sales org and EBS products. 
 *  The following CRM tables are in scope for this update: 

 *  ECL_Tank 
 *  ECL_TankOrder 
 *  ECL_OrderDetail (Tank Order Detail) 
 

 *  Scope Rules 

 *  Updates apply only to records linked to 1C accounts 

 *  1C account = account linked to a district with 1C flag enabled 
 

 *  Non-1C accounts are explicitly out of scope 
 *  Mapping from NSAP product ? EBS product is based on the approved product mapping file 
 *  No new product creation is in scope—existing EBS product records only

b. Tank Order (ecl_tankorder)  

 *  Precondition - A tank order record linked to a 1C account. 
 *  After the data conversion package is executed, 'ecl_salesorgid' is updated to CA10. 
 

c. Tank Order Details (ecl_orderdetails) 

 *  Tank order details record linked to a 1C account, where 'ecl_productnumberid' and 'ecl_tankproductnumber' lookups refer to an NSAP product and an equivalent EBS product exists in the mapping file provided by business.  
 *  After the data conversion package is executed, 'ecl_productnumberid' and 'ecl_tankproductnumber' are updated with the EBS product GUID whose Legacy Product look-up points to the original NSAP Product  
 *  'ECL_ProductName' attribute is updated to reflect the newly updated EBS product name, instead of the legacy NSAP product name.

865792,User Story,,,,,,DC: Create Product–SalesOrg Mappings for CA10 Using EBS Equivalent Products from SalesOrg 2001,,,"As a data conversion analyst,
 
I want to create new Product–SalesOrg linkages in CRM for SalesOrg CA10,
 
so that all EBS (Hygiene) equivalent products currently associated with SalesOrg 2001 (Water) are available for use under CA10 opportunities and quotes as part of the One Customer model for FBU Canada.
 

 
Background and Rationale:

 *  Under the One Customer R1 Canada initiative, all FBU Canada accounts are transitioning to a unified Hygiene SalesOrg (CA10). 
 *  Currently, products used by Water accounts are linked to SalesOrg 2001 in CRM. 
 *  To enable those same products for use by Hygiene accounts, we must create corresponding Product–SalesOrg records for CA10 using the EBS equivalent product numbers provided by the business. 
 *  The business has been asked to share a validated mapping file that includes: 

 *  Product Number (2001 Water) 
 *  Product Name (2001 Water) 
 *  EBS Product Name (Hygiene Equivalent) 
 *  EBS Product Number (Hygiene Equivalent) 
 *  “Needed under CA10” (Y/N) 
 

 *  Using this file, the CRM data team will create records in the Product Sales Org table (linking EBS products to CA10). 
 *  This ensures that EBS products are available for CA10 transactions and that product filtering logic remains consistent for Water and Hygiene accounts after the transition. 
 
 *  The business-approved Excel mapping file identifies legacy NSAP products and their new EBS equivalents. 
 *  Some products available for Water (2001) must also be available for Hygiene (CA-10). 
 *  The file includes a flag “Needed under CA-10” = Yes indicating which EBS products require mapping to CA-10. 
 *  After EBS products are created in CRM (per the previous story), those flagged items must also appear under CA-10 for pricing, templates, and transactional readiness. 
 

 
 
",,Removed,,\FBU 1C\Data,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,6,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 

 *  Identify eligible products 

 *  Given the validated business Excel file lists products linked to sales org 2001, 
 *  When a product’s “Needed under CA10  flag is marked Yes, 
 *  Then that product must be evaluated for creation of a CA-10 mapping. 
 

 *  Verify product presence 

 *  Given a product marked “Needed under CA10  has already been created in CRM, 
 *  When validation is performed, 
 *  Then that product must also appear as available under sales org CA10 . 
 

 *  Prevent duplicates 

 *  Given a product is already linked to CA10 in CRM, 
 *  When the data-conversion script runs, 
 *  Then no additional duplicate mapping should be created for that same product. 
 

 *  Capture errors and completion 

 *  Given all flagged products are processed, 
 *  When mapping results are reviewed, 
 *  Then every product should have a clear outcome recorded – Created, Already Exists, or Failed – and summary counts should match expectations. 
 

 

 

 


 
 
Dependencies:

 *  Business dependency: Business to provide EBS Product mapping file for SalesOrg 2001 with columns: 

 *  Needed under CA10 (Y/N) 
 *  EBS Product Name 
 *  EBS Product Number 
 

 *  Integration dependency: EBS equivalent products must exist in CRM before linkage creation. 
 


 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Target table: ecl_productsalesorg (N:N relationship between Product and Sales Org). 
 *  Source table: NSAP_EBS_Product_SalesOrg_Mapping (from previous story). 
 *  Required technical elements: 

 *  Add a column SalesOrg_GUID to store the CRM GUID for each sales org used during mapping creation. 
 *  Use this GUID when inserting into the NH20_ProductSalesOrg_Mapping table to avoid lookup ambiguity. 
 

 *  Processing logic: 

 *  Filter records where SalesOrg = 2001 and Needed_Under_CA10 = 'Yes' and New_EBS_Product_GUID is not null. 
 *  Check for existing CA-10 mappings in NH20_ProductSalesOrg_Mapping. 
 *  If not found, insert a new mapping using the CA-10 Sales Org GUID and the EBS Product GUID. 
 *  Update staging table status (Created / Exists / Failed) and timestamp. 
 *  Log exceptions to the generic conversion error log table. 
 *  Produce a post-execution summary (total processed, created, exists, failed). 
 

 *  Validation: compare source Excel counts vs CRM mappings to confirm 1-to-1 coverage of all “Needed under CA-10” products.

Analyze Current Logic 
• Analyze and sync with CRM team on findings, and if any new fields will need to be updated with this job.
• Document what happens errors occur and a plan on how to re-load the data

 
Document Key risks 
• Define and document any risks with running this job before 1C model changes

This requirement is to ensure from a data migration perspective when multiple CRM records exist for the same customer (multiple water hygiene and water accounts) they are merged into 1 SSA. 
To Do: 
-Determine what sales skill accounts are duplicates rules are TBD and finalized. View from snowflake if applicable needs to be identified. 
-Decide on how to merge the duplicate sales skill. What tool do to use (Kingsway soft SSIS, ADF) 
-Mappings and which attribute is the true value. 
 Business Capabilities: 
 

 *   Identify cases where multiple CRM records exist for the same customer (e.g., multiple hygiene or water accounts). 
 *   Trigger controlled merges in CRM to consolidate duplicates before linking to the BCA. 
 *   Ensure merges preserve data integrity and maintain CDM key continuity. 
 

 
Technical Implementation: 

 *  Existing Account Analysis: Detailed account extract from CRM will need to be identified. Rules are TBD and finalized.

 

 
 *  Existing Account Update / Merge: Once analysis is complete the extract will need to be run in the pipeline and deactivate the duplicate sales skill, and either create a new SSA with the new merged SSA information or merge the SSA into an existing on 
 

Deliverables:

 *  Accounts marked as a 1C account which have duplicate Sales Skills will be merged into 1 with the relevant attributes.

864041,User Story,,,,,,DC: Update Parent Account (H5) Alignment Across Linked Accounts,,," 
As a data conversion analyst,
I need to update the Parent Account (H5) field on Water and Hygiene account records based on business-provided mappings and existing Hygiene H5 relationships,
 
so that all account records reflect the correct parent H5 link under the One Customer (1C) model and ensure accurate hierarchical alignment between Water (NSAP) and Hygiene (EBS) accounts.

 
Background and Rationale: 
 
Under the One Customer (1C) model, each customer will have a single parent H5 account representing the unified relationship across business divisions.
Currently:
 

 *  Water (NSAP) and Hygiene (EBS) accounts have separate H5 parent accounts. 
 *  Some Water accounts have no valid H5 from EBS. 
 *  Hygiene H5s from EBS are considered the system of record for surviving H5s post–One Customer transition. 
 

 
The objective of this data conversion story is to: 

 *  Align Water accounts with the same H5 as their corresponding Hygiene accounts where both exist. 
 *  Update Water-only accounts using the H5s provided by the business mapping extract. 
 *  Identify and flag accounts where the provided H5 does not yet exist in CRM — to be created and linked automatically by integration. 
 *  Skip Hygiene-only accounts, as they already have the correct H5 linkage from EBS integration. 
 

 
This process ensures all accounts are correctly parented under the right H5, preserving downstream visibility and roll-up logic for CRM, Power BI, and Hub-integrated applications. 

 
","Yellapantula, Siva",New,Data Migration,\FBU 1C\Data,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Moved out of state Rejected,Business,4,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 

 *  Scenario 1 – Update H5 Alignment for Water + Hygiene Accounts 

 *  Given a Water account (Legacy Source = NSAP) and a Hygiene account (Legacy Source = EBS) exist for the same customer, 
 *  When the data conversion process runs, 
 *  Then: 

 *  The Water account’s Parent Account (H5) field must be updated to match the H5 value from the linked Hygiene account. 
 *  Both accounts must reflect the same parent H5 in CRM. 
 *  The output extract must list both records with the validation status as “Updated – Matched to Hygiene H5”. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 2 – Update H5 for Water-Only Accounts (Business Mapping Provided)  

 *  Sub-scenario 2a – H5 Exists in CRM  

 *  Given a Water account (Legacy Source = NSAP) with no Hygiene counterpart exists, and the business has provided an H5 mapping,  
 *  When the provided H5 exists in CRM,  
 *  Then:  

 *  The data conversion process must update the account’s Parent Account (H5) field with the provided H5 record.  
 *  The process must log the record as “Updated – H5 Assigned from Mapping” in the extract.  
 

 

 *  Sub-scenario 2b – H5 Does Not Exist in CRM  

 *  Given a Water account (Legacy Source = NSAP) with no Hygiene counterpart exists, and the provided H5 mapping refers to an H5 not found in CRM,  
 *  When the data conversion process runs,  
 *  Then:  

 *  The account must not be updated.  
 *  The record must be flagged in the output extract with the status “Skipped – Pending Integration Creation.”  
 *  The integration process will subsequently create the missing H5 in CRM and establish the link automatically.  
 *  No updates are performed by this data conversion job in this scenario.  
 

 

 

 *  Scenario 3 – Hygiene-Only Accounts (No Update Needed) 

 *  Given an account (Legacy Source = EBS) with Sales Skill = Hygiene and no corresponding Water account exists, 
 *  When the data conversion process runs, 
 *  Then: 

 *  The Parent Account (H5) field remains unchanged. 
 *  The record is logged in the extract as “No Action – Hygiene Account Retains Existing H5.”

864040,User Story,,,,,,DC: Update Market Segment and Sub-Segment Alignment Across Linked Accounts,,," 
As a data conversion analyst,
I need to update the Market Segment and Sub-Segment fields across all Water and Hygiene accounts impacted by the One Customer (1C) program,
 
so that the Market Segment/Sub-Segment values remain harmonized and aligned with business-provided mappings or Hygiene account values, ensuring consistency across linked accounts in CRM and downstream systems.

 
Background and Rationale:
In the One Customer (1C) model, Water (NSAP) and Hygiene (EBS) accounts that belong to the same customer will be aligned under a single Base Customer Account (BCA). 
Currently, both divisions maintain independent Market Segment and Sub-Segment values — often using different naming conventions and hierarchies.
 
To achieve harmonization: 

 *  For Water-only accounts (no Hygiene counterpart), the business will provide a mapping sheet that specifies: 

 *  Existing Water Market Segment / Sub-Segment 
 *  Equivalent EBS (Hygiene) Market Segment / Sub-Segment to be updated to. 
 *  This mapping will be applied by the data conversion script. 
 

 *  For Water + Hygiene pairs under the same customer (linked by BCA), the Market Segment and Sub-Segment values from the Hygiene account will serve as the system of record, and must be propagated to the corresponding Water account. 
 

 
This ensures harmonization of segmentation data and prevents misalignment across CRM, reporting, and analytics platforms post-migration.

 *  Given an account exists in CRM with: 
 *  Legacy Source = NSAP 
 *  Sales Skill = Water 
 *  and no linked Hygiene account under the same BCA, 
 *  When the data conversion process runs,

 *  The update must only occur if both new mapped values are available in the file. 
 *  If a valid mapping is missing, the record must be flagged in an exception log for manual review. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 2 – Linked Water and Hygiene Accounts (Copy Hygiene Values) 

 *  Given a Water account (Legacy Source = NSAP) and a Hygiene account (Legacy Source = EBS) exist for the same customer, both linked to the same BCA, 
 *  When the data conversion process runs, 
 *  Then: 

 *  The process must copy the Market Segment and Sub-Segment values from the Hygiene account to the Water account. 
 *  Both fields on the Water account must exactly match the Hygiene account’s values. 
 *  The update must overwrite any existing Water values to ensure alignment. 
 *  A confirmation log entry must record the Hygiene ? Water account ID mapping and the new applied values. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 3 – Null or Incomplete Hygiene Values 

 *  Given a Water account is linked to a Hygiene account under the same BCA, 
 *  When the Hygiene account has null or blank Market Segment or Sub-Segment values, 
 *  Then: 

 *  The Water account must not be updated. 
 *  The record must be logged in the exception report with the message “Missing Hygiene Segment/Sub-Segment” for business follow-up.

As a data conversion analyst,
I need to update and harmonize single-system Sold-To accounts (either hygiene-only in EBS or water-only in NSAP) during the 1C consolidation,
 
so that these accounts are properly aligned to the One Customer model, linked to a Base Customer Account (BCA), and updated with the correct master data.
 

 
In the hygiene-only (EBS) scenario, minimal updates are needed — simply update the sales skill to Hygiene, create a BCA, and establish linkage.
 

 
In the water-only (NSAP) scenario, more extensive enrichment is required to align with EBS standards, including updates to account number, ERP system, name, address, district, sales org, and market segment/sub-segment mappings.
 

 
This ensures consistency, data integrity, and readiness for R1 Canada go-live, while maintaining a scalable pattern for future markets (e.g., U.S. in R2)

 *  Update sales skill on the account record to Hygiene 
 *  Flag the Account record for a new BCA creation 
 *  Create a BCA record does not exist already 
 *  Link the BCA with the account 
 

 *  Water-Only (NSAP) 

 *  Update the following account attributes: 
 *  Account number ? EBS-provided number 
 *  ERP system ? ECL_EBS 
 *  Account name ? EBS-provided name 
 *  District ? fetched from hygiene district linked to same primary owner 
 *  Sales Org ? fetched from SalesOrg–District intersection (for Canada R1 = C8N) 
 *  Flag the Account record for a new BCA creation

 *  Market segment and sub-segment updated per mapping provided by business (see dependency below) (This will be handled via different user story, so this user story should not cover the Market Segment and Sub-Segment updates) 
 *  Parent Account updated only if business provides surviving H5 linkage; otherwise left blank for EBS auto-setup (This will be handled via different user story, so this user story should not cover the Parent Account updates) 
 

 *  And the sales skill on the account must be updated to Water 
 *  And the Account must be flagged for a new BCA creation 
 *  And a new Base Customer Account (BCA) must be created. (This will be handled via different user story, so this user story should not cover the BCA Creation) 
 *  And the BCA must be linked to the updated account. (This will be handled via different user story, so this user story should not cover the updates to the BCA lookup on the Account record)

863529,User Story,,,,,,DC: Harmonize One-to-One Hygiene + Water Cross-System Sold-To - SOLD_TO_3,,,"As a data conversion analyst, I need to handle the special case where a single surviving account exists across both EBS and NSAP systems with duplicate Sold-To records but different legacy account numbers, so that the consolidated records correctly reflect sales skill alignment, account numbers, addresses, and parent hierarchy in line with the One Customer model.
 

 
Background & Example:
 

 *  Example Survivor Account: 502662615 
 *  Situation: One Hygiene Sold-To exists in EBS and one Water Sold-To exists in NSAP, both mapping to the same survivor account but holding different legacy account numbers. 
 *  Requirement: Ensure proper alignment of sales skill, account number, address, parent account (H5), and market attributes between the survivor and both sales skill accounts during conversion. 
 

 
This ensures that data continuity is maintained across systems, both Hygiene and Water sales skill accounts are fully aligned, and all necessary attributes are consistently carried over. 

 

 
Business Requirements:

 *  Sales Skill Alignment 

 *  Update the sales skill on the account record with legacy source = EBS ? Hygiene. 
 *  Update the sales skill on the account record with legacy source = NSAP ? Water. 
 

 *  Account Number Updates 

 *  Update the account number of the survivor account (502662615) consistently across both Water and Hygiene sales skill accounts. 
 

 *  District & Sales Org Alignment 

 *  Ensure that Market Segment, Sub-Segment, District, and Sales Org values are updated and aligned correctly on the Water sales skill account. 
 

 *  Address Synchronization 

 *  On the Hygiene sales skill account, ensure the following address fields are updated and correct: 

 *  Address Line 1 
 *  Address Line 2 
 *  City 
 *  Country 
 *  State/Province 
 *  Zip/Postal Code 
 

 *  Propagate the same address values from the Hygiene sales skill account to the Water sales skill account to maintain consistency. 
 

 *  Parent Account (H5) Alignment 

 *  The H5 parent account value present on the Hygiene account must also be updated and linked to the Water account to ensure both share the same parent H5. 
 

 

 

 
 
","Khan, Munira",Pending PO Review,Data Migration,\FBU 1C\Data,"Nguyen, Chau",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.06,2,Moved out of state In Test,Business,8,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 
 

 *  Scenario 1: Sales Skill Updates 

 *  Given an account record exists with legacy source = EBS tied to the survivor account, 
 *  When the data conversion process runs, 
 *  Then the sales skill on the record is updated to Hygiene. 
 *  And for the NSAP record (legacy source = NSAP), the sales skill is updated to Water. 
 

 *  Scenario 2: Account Number Updates 

 *  Given duplicate legacy Sold-To accounts exist across EBS and NSAP, 
 *  When the survivor account number (502662615) is identified, 
 *  Then both the Water and Hygiene sales skill accounts are updated to carry this same survivor account number. 
 

 *  Scenario 3: District/Sales Org Alignment 

 *  Given the Water sales skill account exists under the survivor record, 
 *  When the data conversion updates are applied, 
 *  Then Market Segment, Sub-Segment, District, and Sales Org values must be populated consistently from the survivor Hygiene account 
 

 *  Scenario 4: Address Synchronization (This will be handled via the new EBS ADF Integration ) 

 *  Given the Hygiene sales skill account is updated with complete address fields,  
 *  When data conversion updates run,  
 *  Then those same address values are copied into the corresponding Water sales skill account.  
 

 *  Scenario 5: Parent H5 Alignment (Covered as a part of a different user story) 

 *  Given the Hygiene sales skill account has a parent H5 assigned,  
 *  When the conversion completes,  
 *  Then the Water sales skill account is updated with the same H5 parent value.

Scenario 4: Survivor account only with EBS account and not havingNSAP account 
1. Precondition: Multiple Hygiene Sold-To exists in EBS withno   Water Sold-To exists in NSAP, mapping to thesame survivor account but holding different legacy account numbers
2.   After the Data Conversion package is executed, the sales skill on theaccount record with legacy source as EBS is updated to Hygiene and No waterskills should be added under survivor account 
  
Scenario 5: Survivor account only with NSAP account and nothaving EBS account 
1. Precondition: No Hygiene Sold-To exists in EBS and Multiple   Water Sold-To exists in NSAP, mapping to thesame survivor account but holding different legacy account numbers

864038,User Story,,,,,,DC: Data Preparation: Generate Market Segment and Sub-Segment Mapping Extract for Business Validation,,,"As a data conversion analyst,
I need to generate and share a comprehensive extract of all accounts requiring Market Segment and Sub-Segment validation,
 
so that the business can review current Water and Hygiene account segment data, confirm mappings, and provide equivalent EBS-aligned Market Segment and Sub-Segment values for the Canada scope under the One Customer program.
 

 
Background and Rationale 
Under the One Customer (1C) initiative, Water (NSAP) and Hygiene (EBS) accounts are being consolidated under a unified Base Customer Account (BCA) model. 
To ensure data consistency, Market Segment and Sub-Segment fields on legacy Water accounts must be aligned to their EBS equivalents before migration.
 
The business will validate and provide mapping logic that ensures harmonized segmentation across both divisions for all Canadian accounts.
 

 
The IT team will therefore generate an extract of all applicable accounts — primarily Water-only accounts, but also paired Water and Hygiene accounts for reference — capturing key identifiers and classification details.
 
This extract will serve as the foundation for business mapping input (dependency D1).

","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,Data Migration; dependency; Refine,\FBU 1C\Data,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,2,"Business Acceptance Criteria: 

 *  Scenario 1 – Identify All Relevant Accounts 

 *  Given the CRM data source contains both Water (NSAP) and Hygiene (EBS) accounts for Canada, 
 *  When the extract process executes, 
 *  Then all Water-only accounts (those without Hygiene counterparts) must be included, 
 *  And any paired Water + Hygiene accounts belonging to the same customer or potential BCA must also be included for comparison. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – Extract Required Account Attributes 

 *  Given accounts are identified for inclusion, 
 *  When the extract is generated, 
 *  Then the following columns must be populated for each record: 

 *  Account GUID 
 *  Account Number 
 *  Account Name 
 *  Legacy Source (EBS or NSAP) 
 *  Sales Skill (Water / Hygiene) 
 *  Current Market Segment 
 *  Current Sub-Segment 
 *  Primary Owner 
 *  Owner 
 *  District Name  
 *  Sales Org  
 *  Country (should = “Canada"") 
 *  Account Status (Active / Inactive) 
 *  Future Market Segment (Must be left blank for Business to provide) 
 *  Future Sub-Segment  (Must be left blank for Business to provide) 
 

 

 *  Scenario 3 – Apply Inclusion & Filtering Logic 

 *  Given multiple account records exist in CRM, 
 *  When the extract logic runs, 
 *  Then include only: 
 *  Accounts where Country = Canada 
 *  Account Type = Customer or Sales Skill Account 
 *  Active Status = True 
 *  And exclude test and deactivated records. 
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Output & Delivery 

 *  Given the extract generation completes successfully, 
 *  When the file is finalized, 
 *  Then it must be exported in .xlsx format, 
 *  And stored in the designated SharePoint folder, 
 *  And the business team must be notified with a timestamp and record count summary. 
 

 *  Scenario 5 – Data Quality Verification 

 *  Given the extract is ready for delivery, 
 *  When developer performs pre-delivery checks, 
 *  Then total record count and column completeness must match expected account totals, 
 *  And any records with blank Market Segment or Sub-Segment values must be flagged in a separate “Exception Tab” within the workbook for business attention.

864039,User Story,,,,,,DC: Data Preparation: Generate H5 Parent Account Alignment Extract for Business Review,,,"As a data conversion analyst,
I need to generate an extract listing all Water and Hygiene accounts requiring H5 parent account alignment validation,
 
so that the business can confirm or provide the correct Hygiene H5 (parent account) linkage for each Water-only account, ensuring proper hierarchy and data consistency for the One Customer (1C) migration.
 

 
Background and Rationale: 
In the current CRM environment, both Water (NSAP) and Hygiene (EBS) accounts have Parent Account (H5) values populated. 
However, for Water-only accounts, the existing H5 (Parent Account) reference is tied to Water H5 records, which will no longer be valid after the One Customer migration.
 

 
Under the new model, all accounts should roll up to a Hygiene-derived H5 (from EBS).
 
Therefore, business validation is required to identify — for each Water-only account — which Hygiene H5 should become its future Parent Account.
 

 
The development team will share an extract of accounts where alignment is required. The business will review and populate the corresponding Hygiene H5 name and number, or confirm if a new H5 needs to be created.

 ","Nguyen, Chau",Removed,Data Migration; Discuss; Refine,\FBU 1C\Data,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Moved out of state Rejected,Business,2,"Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Scenario 1 – Identify Accounts Requiring H5 Parent Account Alignment 

 *  Given the CRM dataset contains all active Canada accounts from EBS (Hygiene) and NSAP (Water), 
 *  When the extract generation logic runs, 
 *  Then it must identify: 
 *  All Water-only accounts (Legacy Source = NSAP) that currently reference a Water H5, and 
 *  Any Water + Hygiene pairs linked to different H5s, 
 *  So that business can review and confirm which Hygiene H5 should serve as the future parent for each Water account. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – Include Required Data Fields in Extract 

 *  Given the accounts are identified for H5 alignment validation, 
 *  When the extract is generated, 
 *  Then each record must include the following columns: 

 *  Account GUID 
 *  Account Number 
 *  Account Name 
 *  Legacy Source (EBS / NSAP) 
 *  Sales Skill (Water / Hygiene) 
 *  Current Parent Account Name 
 *  Current Parent Account Number 
 *  Owner (Owner field value in CRM) 
 *  Primary Owner  
 *  District Name 
 *  Sales Org 
 *  Country (e.g., CA) 
 *  Account Status (Active / Inactive) 
 *  Future Parent Account Name (Must be left blank for the business to fill) 
 *  Future Parent Account Number (Must be left blank for the business to fill) 
 

 *  And any Water accounts with Parent Account tied to Water H5 should be clearly marked as “Requires Hygiene H5 Alignment.” 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Apply Inclusion and Filtering Logic 

 *  Given the CRM dataset contains accounts from multiple countries and types, 
 *  When the extract logic executes, 
 *  Then include only: 

 *  Active accounts with Country = Canada 
 *  Account Type = Customer or Sales Skill Account 
 

 *  And exclude: 

 *  Deactivated or test accounts 
 *  Non-customer reference accounts 
 

 

 *  Scenario 4 – Output and Delivery Format 

 *  Given the extract completes successfully, 
 *  When the file is generated, 
 *  Then it must be delivered as an Excel (.xlsx) file containing: 

 *  Sheet 1: All accounts requiring H5 parent validation 
 *  Sheet 2: Exception list (where Parent Account is missing, invalid, or flagged for Water H5 replacement) 
 

 *  And the extract must include clear column headers, date/time stamp, and be delivered to the business data validation team for review. 
 

 *  Scenario 5 – Data Quality and Traceability 

 *  Given the extract is finalized, 
 *  When developer performs internal validation, 
 *  Then: 

 *  The number of records must reconcile with the expected count of Water-only and mismatched H5 accounts for 1C migration. 
 *  The “Requires Hygiene H5 Alignment” flag must appear correctly for impacted records. 
 

 *  Any missing or ambiguous data should appear in the exception sheet with a clear “Reason” column (e.g., Missing H5, Invalid Reference, No Hygiene Match).

863528,User Story,,,,,,"DC: Consolidate Multi-System Sold-To Accounts (Hygiene-only in EBS, Water-only in NSAP) Within One System - SOLD_TO_2 and SOLD_TO_9",,,"As a data conversion analyst,
 
I need to merge and harmonize Sold-To accounts that exist only in a single system (either multiple Hygiene in EBS or multiple Water in NSAP),
 
so that duplicate Sold-To accounts are consolidated into one surviving record, enriched with the correct master data, and properly linked to a Base Customer Account (BCA).
 

 
This ensures clean account hierarchies, accurate sales skill alignment, and full compatibility with the One Customer model.
 

 *  SOLD_TO_2 (Hygiene-only in EBS): Multiple Hygiene Sold-To accounts exist in EBS, no Water counterpart in NSAP. (e.g. 502662556) 
 *  SOLD_TO_9 (Water-only in NSAP): Multiple Water Sold-To accounts exist in NSAP, no Hygiene counterpart in EBS.(e.g. 500086342) 
 

 
Both require merge activities (survivor account chosen, others deactivated), updates to sales skill and master data fields, and BCA creation/linkage. 


Business Requirements: 

 *  Merge Process 

 *  Trigger merge activity for multiple Sold-To accounts ? survivor account remains, others deactivated. 
 *  Child records (contacts, activities, opportunities, SOWs, etc.) must be merged into surviving account. 
 *  Merge logic should be developed as a reusable SSIS package for other conversion scenarios. 
 

 *  Hygiene-only Accounts (SOLD_TO_2) 

 *  Update sales skill = Hygiene 
 *  Create and link BCA 
 

 *  Water-only Accounts (SOLD_TO_9) 

 *  Update sales skill = Water 
 *  Enrich account with updated account number, name, ERP system, address, district, sales org, market segment/sub-segment, parent account (if provided) 
 *  Create and link BCA 
 

 *  Dependencies 

 *  Business to provide Water ? Hygiene Market Segment/Sub-Segment mapping 
 *  Business to confirm Food & Beverage district if multiple candidates exist 
 *  Business to provide surviving H5 parent accounts for re-parenting

 *  SOLD_TO_2  – Multiple Hygiene Sold-To in EBS, No Water in NSAP 

 *  Given multiple Hygiene Sold-To accounts exist in EBS with no Water account in NSAP 
 *  When the data conversion process runs 
 *  Then all the relevant accounts that needs to be merged are flagged for merging, so that all Hygiene Sold-To accounts for the same customer are merged into a single surviving account, with duplicates deactivated (The actual merging is handled in a different user story. This story should group and flag such records that needs to be merged into 1 account so that the other merge SSIS package can be triggered to perform the actual merge) 
 *  And the sales skill on the surviving account is updated to Hygiene 
 *  Flag the surviving Account record for BCA creation 
 *  And a Base Customer Account (BCA) is created and linked to the surviving account (Handled in a different user story) 
 

 *  SOLD_TO_9  – Multiple Water Sold-To in NSAP, No Hygiene in EBS 

 *  Given multiple Water Sold-To accounts exist in NSAP with no Hygiene account in EBS 
 *  When the data conversion process runs 
 *  Then all the relevant accounts that needs to be merged are flagged for merging, so that all Water Sold-To accounts for the same customer are merged into a single surviving account, with duplicates deactivated (The actual merging is handled in a different user story. This story should group and flag such records that needs to be merged into 1 account so that the other merge SSIS package can be triggered to perform the actual merge) 
 *  And the following updates must occur on the surviving account: 

 *  Sales skill updated to Water 
 *  Account number updated to the survivor EBS number 
 *  ERP system updated to ECL_EBS 
 *  Account name updated to match the EBS-provided name 
 *  Address fields (Street1, Street2, City, State/Province, Country, Zip Code) updated to match EBS (This is will be done the new EBS ADF integration) 
 *  District updated by fetching associated Food & Beverage district from the owning team; 

 *  If multiple valid districts exist, business must confirm which one applies 
 

 *  Sales Org updated using District–Sales Org intersection logic (Canada R1 = CA10; must be generic for future rollouts) 
 *  Market Segment and Sub-Segment updated based on mapping provided by business from Water ? Hygiene equivalents (This is handled in a different user story) 
 *  Parent Account updated only if business provides surviving H5 link; otherwise left blank for EBS downstream sync. (This is handled in a different user story) 
 

 *  Flag the surviving Account record for BCA creation 
 *  And a Base Customer Account (BCA) is created and linked to the surviving account. (Handled in a different user story) 
 

 *  Exception Handling 

 *  Given merge cannot be completed due time out or any other conflicts 
 *  When the process runs 
 *  Then exceptions must be logged in an error report with full details for reconciliation with business

863530,User Story,,,,,,"DC: Complex Harmonization with Multiple Hygiene + Multiple Water Sold-To - SOLD_TO_4 , SOLD_TO_5 and SOLD_TO_6",,,"As a data conversion analyst,
I need to merge and align multiple Hygiene and Water Sold-To accounts where a Hygiene account already exists in EBS,
 
so that duplicate accounts are consolidated, all values on Water accounts are synchronized with the Hygiene survivor, and both accounts are linked to the same Base Customer Account (BCA).
 

 
This ensures:
 

 *  Hygiene (EBS) is always the anchor record. 
 *  Water (NSAP) accounts are harmonized to reflect EBS values. 
 *  Both Sales Skills (Hygiene + Water) coexist under the same survivor customer. 
 *  Data integrity and downstream consistency are maintained under the One Customer model. 
 

 
This story covers: 

 *  SOLD_TO_4 (Example: Survivor Account 502662871) 
 *  SOLD_TO_5 (Example: Survivor Account 502669640) 
 *  SOLD_TO_6 (Example: Survivor Account 502951283 
 *  
 
 *  Business Requirements: 
 *  

 *  Merge Logic 

 *  Use SSIS package to merge multiple accounts into survivor ? deactivate duplicates. 
 *  Ensure all child records (contacts, activities, opportunities, SOWs, etc.) are reparented to survivor. 
 *  Reusable package logic to support SOLD_TO_4, SOLD_TO_5, SOLD_TO_6. 
 

 *  Account Field Updates 

 *  From Hygiene survivor (EBS) copy values to Water survivor (NSAP): 
 *  Account Number ? surviving account number 
 *  Account Name ? match EBS Hygiene name 
 *  Address fields (Street1, Street2, City, State/Province, Zip, Country) ? match Hygiene 
 *  District + Sales Org ? match Hygiene (Sales Org via District–Sales Org intersection, generic logic for R1 Canada and future R2 US rollout) 
 *  Market Segment + Sub-Segment ? match Hygiene 
 *  Parent Account ? copy from Hygiene (if present) 
 

 *  Sales Skill Alignment 

 *  Hygiene record ? Sales Skill = Hygiene 
 *  Water record ? Sales Skill = Water 
 

 *  ERP System 

 *  On Water survivor ? set ECL_EBS 
 

 *  BCA Creation & Linkage 

 *  Flag appropriate account records for BCA creation. The actual BCA creation will be handled as part of different user story. 
 *  Create one BCA per consolidated customer 
 *  Link BCA to both Hygiene and Water survivor accounts 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 
","Jain, Sharad",Pending PO Review,Data Migration,\FBU 1C\Data,"Nguyen, Chau",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.06,2,Moved out of state In Test,Business,9,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 

 *  SOLD_TO_4 – Multiple Hygiene (EBS) + One Water (NSAP) 

 *  Example Survivor Account: 502662871 
 *  Given multiple Hygiene Sold-To accounts exist in EBS and one Water Sold-To account exists in NSAP 
 *  When the data conversion process runs 

 *  Then Hygiene accounts must be flagged for merge into one surviving Hygiene account. The actual merge will be done as part of a different user story 
 *  And Water account must be updated with the same values as the Hygiene survivor (account number, name, address, district, sales org, parent account, market segment/sub-segment) 
 *  And Sales Skills must be updated (Hygiene for Hygiene record, Water for Water record) 
 *  And the surviving accounts must be flagged for BCA creation. The actual BCA creation and linking the account to this created BCA is handled in a different user story.  
 

 

 *  SOLD_TO_5 – One Hygiene (EBS) + Multiple Water (NSAP) 

 *  Example Survivor Account: 502669640 
 *  Given one Hygiene Sold-To exists in EBS and multiple Water Sold-Tos exist in NSAP 
 *  When the data conversion process runs 

 *  Then Water accounts must be flagged for merge into one surviving Water account. The actual merge will be done as part of a different user story 
 *  And the surviving Water account must inherit all aligned values from Hygiene (account number, name, address, district, sales org, parent account, market segment/sub-segment) 
 *  And Sales Skills must be updated (Hygiene for Hygiene record, Water for Water record) 
 *  And the surviving accounts must be flagged for BCA creation. The actual BCA creation and linking the account to this created BCA is handled in a different user story.  
 

 

 *  SOLD_TO_6 – Multiple Hygiene (EBS) + Multiple Water (NSAP) 

 *  Example Survivor Account: 502951283 
 *  Given multiple Hygiene Sold-To accounts exist in EBS and multiple Water Sold-To accounts exist in NSAP 
 *  When the data conversion process runs 

 *  Then Hygiene accounts must be flagged for merge into one surviving Hygiene account. The actual merge will be done as part of a different user story 
 *  And Water accounts must be flagged for merge into one surviving Water account. The actual merge will be done as part of a different user story 
 *  And both survivor accounts must be aligned with the same values (account number, name, address, district, sales org, parent account, market segment/sub-segment) 
 *  And Sales Skills must be updated (Hygiene for Hygiene record, Water for Water record) 
 *  And the surviving accounts must be flagged for BCA creation. The actual BCA creation and linking the account to this created BCA is handled in a different user story.  
 

 

 *  Exception Handling 

 *  Given a merge or update cannot complete due to timeout issues 
 *  When the process runs 
 *  Then exceptions must be logged in an error report with record details for business reconciliation

As a CRM Operations and Data Readiness team,
we need to identify all Canada 1C–in-scope prospect records, analyze their address completeness and opportunity linkage, and export structured datasets for Business (Sales Ops) and MDM review,
 
so that informed decisions can be made regarding prospect remediation, deactivation, address completion, and standardization prior to cutover.
 

 *  This story is read-only and analytical in nature. 
 *  No CRM records are updated, deactivated, or modified as part of this story. 
 

 

 

 
Business Context / Background: 

 *  CRM currently contains a large number of Canada prospects created over time with: 

 *  Missing addresses 
 *  Non-standardized addresses 
 *  Potential duplicate records 
 

 *  Upcoming 1C cutover requires: 

 *  Address standardization 
 *  Duplicate prevention 
 *  Clean prospect data to support CRM duplicate checks and MDM alignment 
 

 *  Business has requested: 

 *  Clear visibility into prospects that require action 
 *  Ability to decide which records to remediate, retain, or deactivate 
 

 *  MDM requires a clean, structured dataset to perform address standardization 
 *  This story establishes the single source of truth datasets that drive all downstream cleanup and remediation decisions.
 
 

 

Key Definitions / Rules

 *  Canada 1C scope determination 

 *  Hygiene prospects: linked to a district with 1C flag = Yes 
 *  Water/NSAP prospects: may be linked to legacy NSAP district; CRM team will map NSAP district ? equivalent 1C district team to determine “1C scope” 
 

 *  Address Missing 

 *  Address is considered missing when required minimum address fields are blank (define as: Street 1 is null/blank OR City is null/blank OR State/Province is null/blank OR Country is null/blank OR Zip Code is blank)

 *  Identify Canada 1C-scope prospects 

 *  Given prospects exist in CRM for Canada 
 *  When CRM identifies 1C-scope prospects 
 *  Then include prospects where: 

 *  Country = Canada 
 *  Status = Active 
 *  Account Type = Prospect 
 *  And either: 

 *  Prospect linked to a district with 1C flag = Yes 
 *  Prospect linked to a legacy district that maps to a 1C district team 
 

 

 *  And derive and store (report-only): 

 *  Sales Skill (Hygiene / Water) 
 *  To Be 1C District Team 
 

 

 *  Generate Business Review Dataset (Prospect Analysis List) 

 *  Given a Canada 1C-scope prospect 
 *  When The Business review dataset is generated 

 

 *  Then Each record must include all of the following columns: 

 *  Core CRM Record Identifiers 

 *  CRM Prospect ID (GUID) 
 *  Prospect Name 
 *  Created On 
 *  Created By 
 *  Owner 
 *  Primary Owner 
 

 *  Sales & Territory Context 

 *  Sales Skill 
 *  Current District 
 *  To Be 1C District 
 *  Market Segment 
 *  Sub-Segment 
 

 *  Opportunity Context 

 *  Opportunity Count 
 *  Opportunity Created Dates (if applicable) 
 *  Opportunity Presence Indicator (Yes / No) 
 

 *  Address Fields (Exact CRM Field Values) 

 *  Address Line 1 
 *  Address Line 2 
 *  City 
 *  State / Province 
 *  Postal Code 
 *  Country 
 *  ZIP Code 
 

 *  Status Indicators 

 *  Address Present (Yes / No) 
 *  Opportunity Present (Yes / No) 
 *  Candidate for Business Review (Yes) 
 

 

 

 *  Flag Records with Missing Addresses 

 *  Given A prospect record is included in the dataset 
 *  When Address completeness is evaluated 
 *  Then Records must be explicitly flagged where: 

 *  One or more required address fields are missing 
 

 *  And These records must be clearly identifiable for: 

 *  Business remediation 
 *  Business decision on deactivation vs. address completion 
 

 *  Sorting and Grouping for Duplicate Visibility 
 *  Given The Business review dataset is generated 
 *  When The dataset is prepared for sharing 
 *  Then Records must be sorted by standardized address grouping, such that: 

 *  Identical or near-identical addresses appear adjacent 
 

 *  This enables Business to visually assess potential duplicates easily 
 

 *  Generate MDM Address Standardization Dataset 

 *  Given Prospects have complete address information 
 *  When The MDM dataset is generated 
 *  Then A separate export must be created for MDM containing: 

 *  CRM Prospect ID (GUID) – mandatory for round-trip matching 
 *  Prospect Name 
 *  Full address fields exactly as stored in CRM 
 *  The dataset must conform to the MDM-agreed input format 
 

 *  The Prospect Data shared with the MDM Team should be in this Format

As a CRM Technical Architect, I need to investigate and define the merge and deduplication logic for Water and Hygiene customer accounts so that:

 *  Customers have only one surviving Water account and one surviving Hygiene account where applicable. 
 *  Surviving accounts are linked to their corresponding Base Customer Account (BCA) if they belong to the One Customer (1C) program. 
 *  All references (Ship To, Sold To, child data) are preserved and/or correctly reassigned to the surviving account(s). 
 *  Dependencies on SSIS packages, integration triggers, and pipelines are identified and documented. 
 *  Templates are prepared to share with the business for review/validation, showing how opportunities, TVDs, RTWs, and other child records will be handled post-merge. 
 *  A technical approach is documented to ensure consistency, traceability, and ability to validate completeness of the merges. 
 

 
The spike will cover: 

 *  Merge logic rules: determining surviving Water/Hygiene accounts. 
 *  Deduplication strategy: ensuring no duplicate Water or Hygiene accounts are linked to the same BCA. 
 *  Child data impacts: opportunities, RTWs, TVDs, service visits, contacts. 
 *  Validation approach: how to verify all records moved correctly and nothing is lost. 
 *  Fallback/contingency: handling if pipeline automation fails (manual SSIS scripts). 
 

 
 

Run / create POC in Ecolab Dev environment that shows the account merge functionality in SSIS kingsway soft. 

 

 
Merge logic is as follows 
-Identification number maps to ""Account Number"" in dynamics. 
-Business partner = EBS account number 

 
Example 1 

 *  EBS 0507088865 will merge with 503334831 
 *  Sales Skill will be Hygiene  
 

 *  2 NA_SAP Accounts we need to compare what the differences are surviving NSAP account and update the NSAP account Numbers with with 503334831 
 *  Sales Skill Water 
 

 *  Create  BCA with the Business Parter Number of 503333831 and update the Child Accounts with the newly created BCA 
 

Example 2 

 *  Merge 0503331975 with 0503339383 and udpate them with the number 503331982 
 *  Sales Skill Hygiene 
 *  Create  BCA with the Business Parter Number of 503331982 and update the Child Accounts with the newly created BCA 
 

Example 3 

 *  82111 and 7655 compare diff and see which one survives and update them with the 506 
 *  Sales skill Water 
 *  Create BCA with Business Partner of 5033301506

As a data conversion analyst,

so that CRM and downstream systems maintain a single accurate version of each account while preserving child relationships and data integrity.
 

 
Background and Rationale: 
During the One Customer (1C) implementation, Water (NSAP) and Hygiene (EBS) systems each contain duplicate or versioned Sold-To accounts. These must be merged within their respective legacy sources prior to final BCA linkage. 

 
The merge package will:
 

 *  Use a data conversion control table that lists each account, its country, legacy source, legacy Sold-To or Ship-To numbers, survivor account ID, and target EBS account number. 
 *  Group and merge accounts based on survivor account and legacy source (EBS or NSAP). 
 *  Automatically migrate child records (Opportunities, TVD Programs, RTW, etc.) to the survivor account. 
 *  Flag records for exception handling and produce reconciliation reports. 
 

 
This ensures that for each ERP source, one Water account and one Hygiene account survive per customer — ready for BCA creation.

 *  All child records (see list below) are reparented to the survivor account.  
 *  Source accounts are marked inactive post-merge and logged as “merged.” 
 *  Historical data (created on/by, modified on/by) remains unchanged. 
 *  The ERP Sales Skill should be updated as Hygiene on the survivor account  
 *  The ERP System should be updated as ECL_EBS on the survivor account  
 *  The Account Number should be update to the correct EBS Account Number on the survivor account 
 

 

 

 *  Scenario 2 – Water Account Merge (NSAP Legacy Source) 

 *  Given multiple Water accounts exist in NSAP for the same customer and share the same Survivor Account ID, 
 *  When the merge package runs, 
 *  Then 

 *  All Water (NSAP) source accounts are merged into a single survivor NSAP account. 
 *  Source accounts are marked inactive post-merge and logged as “merged.” 
 *  Historical data (created on/by, modified on/by) remains unchanged. 
 *  The ERP Sales Skill Should be updated as Water on the survivor NSAP account  
 *  The ERP System should be updated as ECL_EBS on the survivor account 
 *  The Account Number should be update to the correct EBS Account Number on the survivor account 
 *  If the survivor EBS account number column is TBD (i.e., final EBS number not yet available), the process skips that record and logs it as “Pending EBS Number.” 
 *  Upon receiving the final EBS number (pre-cutover), those pending records are merged into the EBS account as part of the final cutover batch. 
 

 

 

 *  Scenario 3 – Cross-Source Merging 

 *  Given a customer has records from both NSAP and EBS sources, 
 *  When the merge package runs, 
 *  Then 

 *  All NSAP accounts consolidate first into a single Water account and ERP Sale Skill should be set as Water and ERP System should be updated as ECL_EBS on the survivor account 
 *  All EBS accounts consolidate into a single Hygiene account and ERP Sale Skill should be set as Hygiene and ERP System should be updated as ECL_EBS on the survivor account. 
 *  Account Number should be update to the correct EBS Account Number on the survivor account
 
 *  No direct cross-ERP merge occurs within this package. 
 *  Post-merge, each customer has one EBS (Hygiene) and one NSAP (Water) account remaining. 
 

 

 

 *  Scenario 4 -  Child entities merging. 

 *  Given a merge operation between source and survivor accounts, 
 *  When the merge executes, 
 *  Then all child records are reparented to the survivor account for the following entities: 
 *  Opportunities (active, closed, lost) 
 *  TVD Programs (Total Value Delivered) 
 *  Value Added Services 
 *  RTW / Lost Business 
 *  Service Plans 
 *  Reoccurring Services 
 *  Service Visits 
 *  Cases  
 *  TSRs 
 *  Site Safety Data 
 *  Contacts 
 *  Ship-To Records 
 *  Sites 
 *  Scope of Work (SOW) 
 *  Recommendations 
 *  TVD Targets 
 *  Product Details 
 *  EQR 
 *  Automations 
 *  Implementations 
 *  CIP check target 
 *  Concentration checks target 
 

 *  Documents are excluded for R1 and handled in R2. 
 

 *  Scenario 5 – Exception Handling and Logging 

 *  Given the merge process encounters records that cannot be merged or lack a survivor mapping, 
 *  When the merge package executes, 
 *  Then 

 *  These records are skipped, not failed. 
 *  Each is logged to an exception file with fields: 
 *  Country, Legacy Source, Legacy Sold-To/Ship-To, Survivor Account, Reason, Timestamp. 
 

 *  Exception file is delivered for manual reconciliation.

834694,Requirement,,,,,37. BCA Record Creation via Script or Data Load,,,," 
 
 
Summary 

 
 This requirement is to ensure from a data migration perspective the data will be linked to the Base Customer Account. The Base customer account will be used to provide a holistic view of child sales skills, opportunities, service visits to CAM's and BDMS.  
 To Do 
 

 *  Figure out what view we will be using for the 1 time migration update: Work with Snowflake team / MDM team 
 *  Work with MDM team to add in a legacy account number column for NLC SAP account that has been merged  Work with Snowflake team / MDM team 
 *  Decide on SSIS or ADF job: Work with CRM team  
 *  Decide on ownership logic : MDM team 

 *  Work with MDM to get district sales skill mapping and how they will do it 
 

 *  Ensure district field is updatedconsistently to reflect correct territory alignment post-linkage. Work with MDM to figure out how they mapping and what view is being used
 
 *  Work with CRM team to get views listed and added. I.e what views for BCA: CRM TEAM 
 

 
Business Capabilities: 
 

 *  A new base customer account will be created through a data load. Existing accounts will have their account numbers updated to a new source account number and will be linked to a parent base customer account. 
 *  A comprehensive view of child sales skills will be available, along with their related child entities (such as opportunities, service visits, and sales skills). This will be addressed in a separate story. 
 *  Sales skill will play a key role in future logic. Sales skill data will be integrated, linked to the BCA, and displayed in views. The process for entity creation will be detailed in another story and managed in a separate master data entity. 
 

 
Technical Implementation: 

 *  BCA creation should be done last. Child SSA updates need to occur first with relevant updates before running the BCA creation pipeline. 
 *  Base Customer Account configuration: BCA needs to be created with legacy account number and lookup relationship to account needs to be created (covered in previous story) 
 *  Base Customer Account Creation: 1 Time Migration Create ETL pipeline needs to be created (ADF or SSIS) The pipeline needs to point to data migration view (view is TBD and created by snowflake. The sample provided below is subject to change but provides a semi accurate view of what we can expect.).  Scenarios to handle are. 

 *  1.  There are multiple sales skills for a BCA.  

 *  Logic will group by the ""SOURCE_ACCOUNT_NUMBER"". For each grouping a Base Customer Account record is created with the following mappings if the group has more then 1 account number..  

 *  Base Customer Account Number --> Source Account Number 
 *  Owner:  

 *  will be updated based on the Hygiene's district team if there are 2 sales skill accounts 
 *  will be mapped to the district in snowflake 
 

 *  Primary Owner: TBD need to work with snowflake team on view and mapping 
 

 

 *  2.  Ship To is converted into a Sold To.  

 *  In scenarios where a legacy SHIP-TO becomes a new Sold-To in EBS, generate a new standalone BCA and SSA pair in CRM.
 
 *  Legacy account number is updated with the legacy NSAP account number before it is updated. 
 *  Ensure such cases are flagged during data prep and handled as net-new customer records under the One Customer model. 
 

 

 

 *  Sales skill accounts update: 1 Time update: ETL pipeline needs to be created (ADF or SSIS) pipeline needs to point to data migration view (view is TBD and created by snowflake. The sample provided below is subject to change but provides a semi accurate view of what we can expect) 

 *  Account number ---> Source Account Number 
 *  Legacy Account Number ---> TBD snowflake legacy account number 
 *  Owner:  TBD need to work with snowflake team on view and mapping 
 *  Primary Owner: TBD need to work with snowflake team on view and mapping 
 *  Sales Skills --> SALES_SKILL_NESTED 

 *  Sales skill will need to be related to the Sales Skill Entity (1:N relationship)

Deliverables:
 

 *  Base Customer account will be created child Sales Skill accounts will have a look up to the base customer account  
 *  Base Customer account will have the key attributes that is needed for a holistic CAM / BDM view. View creation is TBD

848843,User Story,,,,,,DC- Create Base Customer Account (BCA) and Link Sales Skill Accounts,,," 
As a data conversion analyst,
I need to create Base Customer Account (BCA) records and link them to the appropriate Water and/or Hygiene accounts based on predefined SQL flagging,
 
so that every customer in the One Customer (1C) model has a unified base-level account with proper ownership, visibility, and consistent data structure across CRM.
 

 
Background and Rationale: 
In the One Customer (1C) model, every customer must be represented by one Base Customer Account (BCA) that unifies both business lines — Water and Hygiene. 
During data conversion, a SQL flagging table will determine which accounts:
 

 *  Require creation of a new BCA. 
 *  Should be linked to a shared BCA (for Water + Hygiene pairs). 
 

 
Each BCA can link to a maximum of two accounts total: 

 *  One Hygiene account and one Water account.

 *  Scenario 1 – Create New BCA for Single Account (Water or Hygiene Only) 

 *  Given an account is flagged as Create New BCA in the SQL flagging table, 
 *  When the data conversion process executes, 
 *  Then 

 *  A new BCA record is created. 
 *  The following field mappings apply: 

 *  BCA Name = Account Name 
 *  BCA Number = Account Number (from EBS) 
 *  ERP Account Status = Active 
 *  Owner = Account Owner (based on the same account) 
 

 

 *  The newly created BCA is linked to that single account via the Base Customer Account lookup. 
 *  The linkage output extract includes: 

 *  Account Name 
 *  Account Number 
 *  Sales Skill 
 *  BCA Name 
 *  BCA Number 
 *  Linkage Status = “Created and Linked.” 
 

 *  No additional accounts are allowed to link to this BCA unless a valid pair (Water + Hygiene) relationship exists. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – Create One BCA for a Water + Hygiene Pair 

 *  Given a pair of accounts (one Water, one Hygiene) are flagged to be linked under a common BCA in the SQL flagging table, 
 *  When the process executes, 
 *  Then 

 *  Only one new BCA record is created. 
 *  Both accounts are linked to that BCA — one with Sales Skill = Water and the other with Sales Skill = Hygiene. 
 *  Mappings follow the Hygiene record (preferred) for consistency: 

 *  BCA Name = Hygiene Account Name 
 *  BCA Number = Hygiene Account Number 
 *  ERP Account Status = Active 
 *  Owner = Hygiene Account Owner 
 

 

 *  The Water account’s Base Customer Account lookup is also updated with this new BCA. 
 *  Output extract logs both records (Water and Hygiene) with shared BCA Number, Account Type, and Linkage Status = “Linked to Common BCA.” 
 *  Validation Rule: Each BCA must link to exactly one Hygiene account and/or one Water account — never more than two accounts total. 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Validation and Error Handling 

 *  Given the BCA creation process runs for all flagged accounts, 
 *  When an error occurs (e.g., duplicate flag, missing owner, invalid account reference, or more than two records mapped to the same BCA), 
 *  Then 

 *  The system must skip creating or linking those accounts. 
 *  Record the exception in a log file with : 

 *  What records are processed 
 *  What records could not get progress 
 *  Error messages 
 *  If the records can be reprocessed 
 

 *  Account Name, Number, Legacy Source (EBS/NSAP), Flag Type, Error Type, and Suggested Action.  
 

 *  Mark exception as “Failed – Manual Review Required.”  
 *  Exception report to be reviewed by the Data Governance and Business teams.

834308,Feature,,,,CRM: Regression Testing for Site Merge/Split Handling,,,,,"This feature encompasses all regression testing activities needed to validate CRM’s ability to correctly process and retain historical data during CDM-driven site merges and rare site splits, as part of the One Customer – F&B United Canada release. While no new regression test framework will be built, all existing CRM logic and integrations must be manually and systematically tested to ensure the preservation of data antiquity—specifically for assets, service plans, service visits, opportunities, activities, and account relationships.

 
The scope of this feature includes comprehensive testing of the following scenarios:
 

 *  Site Merge Scenarios (CDM-Initiated): 

 *  Confirm that when multiple sites are merged in CDM, the surviving site record in CRM retains all associated historical data. 
 *  Ensure assets from all merged sites are correctly re-linked to the survivor site in CRM. 
 *  Validate that service plans, service visits, and opportunities originally tied to inactivated sites now reflect the surviving site, without duplication or data loss. 
 *  Original MDM Site IDs should remain visible on the CRM site record for traceability. 
 

 *  Site Split Scenarios (Rare, Business-Driven): 

 *  When a site is split in CDM into two or more logical sites (e.g., campus segregation), validate that CRM receives the updated site structure and aligns child records (assets, service plans, etc.) accordingly. 
 *  Historical site references (e.g., context point ID) must continue to trace back correctly. 
 *  Special attention required for remapping of asset and action log relationships during split logic. 
 

 *  Asset and Service Record Linkage: 

 *  Validate that all assets remain associated with the appropriate CDM site and CRM sales skill account record post-merge/split. 
 *  Service plans and service visits must not become orphaned, duplicated, or misaligned during merges or splits. 
 

 *  Activity and Opportunity Continuity: 

 *  Test that all activities (emails, tasks, appointments) and opportunities tied to impacted sites or accounts continue to display correctly and retain audit history. 
 

 *  Sales Skill Metadata and Site-Account Mapping: 

 *  Confirm that Sales Skill values remain intact and correctly aligned after merge/split actions. 
 *  Validate that CRM-to-CDM account mappings are updated correctly without overwriting or misrouting records. 
 

 *  Action Logs and Recommendations Integration Validation: 

 *  Ensure Ecolab 3D Action Logs and Recommendations remain linked to the correct asset/site in CRM post-merge. 
 *  Validate any bidirectional sync behavior does not break due to updated site keys. 
 

 *  Edge Case and Sanity Scenarios: 

 *  Validate behavior when merged sites have missing or inconsistent CDM keys. 
 *  Test fallback logic that triggers CRM to auto-create missing sites upon asset sync failure. 
 

 

 
This feature ensures that CRM continues to serve as a trusted record of customer interactions and operational data, even as CDM drives structural changes to the site and account landscape. All validation must be completed before production rollout to avoid downstream reporting, service, or asset management issues.

834677,Requirement,,,,,"33. Regression Testing for Asset, Service Plan, Opportunity, and Site Linkage Post-Merge/Split",,,,"Business Objective
As part of the One Customer initiative, CRM must accurately reflect the evolving site structure from the Master Data Management (MDM) and Customer Data Management (CDM) systems—especially in scenarios where sites are merged or split. These structural changes are initiated outside CRM and must be validated to ensure that critical CRM data (e.g., assets, service plans, opportunities, activities) stay correctly linked to the right site and customer accounts. The goal of this requirement is to ensure CRM maintains data integrity, correct relationships, and accurate visibility after a site merge or split—without requiring any additional build. This is a pure regression testing effort covering all typical and edge-case scenarios. 

 
Business Requirements 
The following regression validations must be performed to ensure CRM behaves as expected post site merge/split: 

 *  Validate Site Merge (Clean Merge) 

 *  When two or more sites are merged in CDM/MDM and a single surviving site is retained, ensure CRM updates correctly. 
 *  Verify that all linked records (assets, service plans, opportunities, activities) move to the surviving site without data loss. 
 *  Example: Two Sold-To sites at the same location are merged into one; CRM must update asset links to point to the merged site. 
 

 *  Validate Site Split (Clean Split) 

 *  When a site is split into multiple distinct sites (e.g., for operational clarity or campus separation), ensure CRM creates the new site records as needed. 
 *  Ensure assets, plans, and opportunities are re-aligned based on CDM instructions or manual mapping inputs. 
 *  Example: A large manufacturing site is split into three zones; specific assets must now point to the newly assigned sites. 
 

 *  Verify Asset Reassignment 

 *  Confirm that assets previously tied to the old site are reassigned correctly to the surviving or newly created site. 
 *  Asset history, ownership, and visibility must be preserved. 
 

 *  Verify Service Plan Continuity 

 *  All active service plans must continue functioning with updated site relationships. 
 *  No plan should break or lose its linkage due to a merge or split. 
 

 *  Opportunity and Activity Linkage 

 *  Opportunities and activities associated with merged or split sites must point to the updated site. 
 *  Ownership and audit trail must remain intact. 
 

 *  Edge Case Handling – Manual Intervention Required 

 *  For complex cases (e.g., one site merged into another but some assets should move elsewhere), CRM may require manual reassignment. 
 *  These edge cases must be identified, documented, and validated during regression. 
 

 *  Standard CRM Merge Logic Behavior 

 *  Validate behavior when using CRM’s out-of-box account merge logic to ensure no conflicts occur with CDM-driven merges. 
 *  Confirm no duplicate data, missed updates, or relationship breakage. 
 

 *  Post-Split Visibility and Security Review 

 *  After a split, ensure that reps assigned to the new sites have access to the correct data (assets, plans, etc.) based on district/team security logic. 
 *  No data should be exposed or hidden unintentionally. 
 

 

 
Regression Testing Considerations 

 *  Testing will span multiple functional areas: Accounts, Assets, Service Plans, Opportunities, and Activities. 
 *  Multiple types of site change scenarios must be validated: 

 *  Clean Site Merge (no manual mapping) 
 *  Clean Site Split (predefined rules or zone logic) 
 *  Merge PCS (partial clean structure merge) 
 *  Manual reassignment required for assets/plans due to unclear mapping 
 

 *  Use representative test data covering both Hygiene and Water divisions. 
 *  Include both standard (automated sync) and manual update scenarios. 
 *  Validate before/after snapshots of records to ensure relationships are maintained. 
 *  Ensure that no CRM integration or Power Automate logic breaks as a result of site reassignment. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  A full regression test suite covering all site merge/split scenarios affecting CRM data 
 *  Documented test cases and outcomes validating successful data transition and preservation 
 *  A list of edge cases identified during testing where manual action or additional guidance is required 
 *  A finalized summary confirming: 

 *  No data loss 
 *  No broken relationships 
 *  Correct visibility and access control 
 

 *  Confirmation that no new development or logic changes are required based on the outcomes, or a follow-up ticket if gaps are found

Background & Rationale
 

 *  Under the One Customer initiative, site structures are evolving: multiple sites may merge into one, or a single site may split into multiple. 
 *  These changes are initiated in MDM/CDM and flow into CRM automatically. 
 *  CRM must correctly realign dependent records (assets, service plans, opportunities, activities) without requiring additional fixes. 
 *  This story is not about new development but a pure regression testing effort to validate CRM behaves correctly under different merge/split scenarios. 
 *  The purpose is to ensure business continuity, correct data ownership, visibility, and audit trails after merges or splits.

 *  Scenario 1 – Clean Site Merge (1C District) 

 *  Given two or more sites are merged in CDM/MDM into a single surviving site, 
 *  When the merge flows into CRM, 
 *  Then all linked records (assets, service plans, opportunities, activities) must point to the surviving site without data loss. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – Clean Site Split (1C District) 

 *  Given a site is split into multiple new sites in CDM/MDM, 
 *  When the split updates flow into CRM, 
 *  Then the new site records must be created, and all dependent records must realign to the appropriate new site as instructed by CDM mapping. 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Asset Reassignment Validation 

 *  Given assets were tied to a merged/split site, 
 *  When the site merge/split process completes, 
 *  Then assets must remain visible under the correct new site while preserving history and ownership. 
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Service Plan Continuity 

 *  Given active service plans exist on a site before merge/split, 
 *  When the site is merged or split, 
 *  Then service plans must continue seamlessly with updated site relationships; no service plan should break. 
 

 *  Scenario 5 – Opportunities & Activities Linkage 

 *  Given opportunities and activities exist on a site, 
 *  When the site is merged or split, 
 *  Then these records must correctly point to the new site while preserving audit trail and ownership history. 
 

 *  Scenario 6 – Edge Case Handling 

 *  Given a site is merged but some assets should be reassigned to a different site, 
 *  When the CRM process completes, 
 *  Then these must be flagged for manual reassignment and documented for reconciliation. 
 

 *  Scenario 7 – Security & Visibility 

 *  Given merges or splits have completed, 
 *  When users access CRM, 
 *  Then visibility must remain correct per CRM security rules (users only see sites/assets/plans they are aligned to).

834309,Feature,,,,"CRM: PowerApps - Validate and Preserve Functionality of Embedded Power Apps (CIPPC, Concentration Check, Inventory Control) Post Account Merge",,,,," 
This feature ensures continuity, data integrity, and visibility for embedded Power Apps used within CRM’s Service Visit forms — specifically the CIPPC (Clean-in-Place Performance Check), Concentration Check, and Inventory Control Apps — following the One Customer account model transformation.

 
These embedded Power Apps are used extensively by field service reps during service visits to:
 

 *  Record site-level CIP and chemical performance measurements (CIPPC, Concentration Check) 
 *  Track inventory usage, replenishment, and counts linked to Sold-To or Site (Inventory Control) 
 

 
These apps are already linked to Service Visits via Sold-To or Site and have no direct dependency on the new Base Customer Account (BCA). However, as part of the One Customer initiative, multiple legacy Sold-To accounts and associated sites will be merged under unified structures, potentially leading to duplicate records, orphaned links, or broken visibility if not handled properly. 

 
This feature is focused on data migration accuracy and regression testing, ensuring the embedded apps continue functioning seamlessly post-merge with no negative impact on reps’ day-to-day operations. There is no planned UI change or major redesign as part of this scope.
 

 
Key Expectations and Scope: 

 *  Preserve Functional Integrity: Ensure CIPPC, Concentration Check, and Inventory Control apps continue working with existing functionality across all scenarios — both in merged One Customer accounts and legacy account structures. 
 *  Validate Data Ownership and Access: Confirm that post-merge ownership and record visibility align correctly based on new account hierarchy and sales skill/team assignments. Maintain historical data ownership and accuracy. 
 *  Handle Data Merges Intelligently: 

 *  Avoid Duplicate Records: In cases where a site existed under two separate Sold-To accounts now being merged, the system must prevent duplicated CIP records or inventory entries. 
 *  Preserve Asset and Site Linkages: Ensure measurements and inventory remain tied to the correct asset, site, and service visit. 
 

 *  Enable Backward Compatibility: All apps must continue working unchanged for legacy accounts not yet transitioned to the One Customer model. 
 *  No Offline Enablement: These apps are not offline-enabled and no scope exists to change this behavior. Field reps must continue to use them as-is via online access. 
 *  Plan Regression Testing for the Following Scenarios: 

 *  Post-merge records accessibility 
 *  Visibility scoping based on sales skill/team alignment 
 *  App linkage with service visits 
 *  Inventory Control entries associated with correct product and Sold-To 
 *  Correct behavior across shared site scenarios 
 

 *  Maintain CRM Integration: Ensure continued syncing of app data into CRM (e.g., measurements, inventory usage) without errors post-merger. 
 *  Adjust Filters If Needed: Preserve or update existing app filters and views to ensure users see only relevant data for assigned Sold-To/Site records.

836356,Requirement,,,,,31. Validate Inventory Control App Functionality and Data Integrity for Merged Sold-To Accounts,,,,"Business Objective
The Inventory Control App is a Power App embedded within service visit forms in Dynamics 365 Field Service, used by field representatives to track product usage, replenishment, and stock levels at a site or Sold-To level. As Ecolab transitions to the One Customer model with consolidated Sold-To accounts, it is critical that the Inventory Control App continues to function seamlessly without data loss, duplication, or access issues. Business users must retain accurate visibility into inventory usage linked to their aligned accounts and assets, and all historical data must remain intact. The objective is to ensure continuity of inventory tracking without any change to the user experience, while preserving the integrity of usage records across merged account structures. 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  The Inventory Control App must work without disruption for all users post-account merge, both for One Customer and legacy account structures. 
 *  All inventory data—usage logs, replenishment entries, and product records—must remain correctly linked to the appropriate Sold-To accounts or sites. 
 *  Where multiple Sold-To accounts previously referenced the same site or asset and are now merged, the system must ensure duplicate inventory usage entries are not created. 
 *  Ownership and visibility must respect the CRM security model, ensuring users see only what they are authorized to access. 
 *  Any records previously associated with deactivated or merged Sold-To accounts must still be traceable and viewable in context. 
 *  No changes are required or expected in the app’s UI, forms, or core functionality from a business user perspective. 
 *  The Inventory Control App should continue to function for accounts that have not transitioned to the One Customer structure (i.e., backward compatibility). 
 *  Where a site is shared across business lines (e.g., Water and Hygiene), inventory records must still be scoped properly per the assigned team, preserving team-specific visibility. 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Conduct comprehensive regression testing for Inventory Control App across merged and legacy Sold-To accounts. 
 *  Confirm that product usage and replenishment records are not duplicated due to merged account references or shared site linkages. 
 *  Validate that all historical inventory records retain correct ownership, date alignment, and service visit linkage. 
 *  Test and confirm that CRM security roles continue to govern access appropriately based on the user’s assigned team and district. 
 *  No technical changes to the Power App are expected, but data model validation is required to ensure merged data integrity. 
 *  Review any legacy Sold-To or site references in the backend to ensure there are no orphaned records post-migration. 
 *  Validate filtering and lookups used in the app still work as expected when a user navigates to the app from within a merged account context. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Regression test results confirming Inventory Control App works as expected across all merged and legacy accounts. 
 *  Confirmation that no duplicate inventory records were introduced due to account merges. 
 *  Documentation of data validation checks confirming integrity of usage and replenishment records. 
 *  Security validation confirming correct user access and visibility. 
 *  Backward compatibility assurance for accounts not yet converted to the One Customer model. 
 *  Final sign-off from business stakeholders validating end-to-end data integrity and visibility for field users.

It allows field representatives to track product usage, replenishment, and top-levels at a site or Sold-To level. With the One Customer (1C) initiative introducing consolidated Sold-To accounts and merged site structures, it is critical that the app continues to operate with full accuracy, security, and backward compatibility.
 

 
This story does not involve new development. The objective is validation that functionality, visibility, and ownership integrity remain intact post-migration.
 

 
Background & Rationale:

 *  Current State: The Inventory Control App is fully operational, tied to Sold-To and site-level data, and enforces CRM security for visibility. 
 *  Post-1C Risks: With merged Sold-To accounts and restructured H5 hierarchies, potential risks include: 

 *  Loss of historical usage records 
 *  Duplication of inventory data across merged sites 
 *  Broken links between inventory records and Sold-To/site references 
 *  Unauthorized access due to misaligned security rules 
 

 *  Objective: Verify continuity, prevent regressions, and ensure users can continue tracking and reporting on inventory without changes to the UI. 
 

 
 
","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,Discuss; Refine,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,2,"Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Scenario 1 – Inventory Continuity Post-1C 

 *  Given a site with inventory usage records linked to a Sold-To account that has been merged under 1C 
 *  When a field rep opens the Inventory Control App during a service visit 
 *  Then the app must load successfully, display existing usage records, and allow updates with no data loss. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – Historical Records 

 *  Given historical inventory usage records exist for a Water or Hygiene Sold-To account 
 *  When the Sold-To account is consolidated under 1C 
 *  Then those records must remain visible, correctly attributed, and not duplicated. 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Security Enforcement 

 *  Given CRM security restricts reps to their aligned accounts/sites 
 *  When the Inventory Control App is used post-1C migration 
 *  Then users must only see inventory data for accounts/sites they are aligned to; no unauthorized records are exposed. 
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Backward Compatibility 

 *  Given a field rep accesses the app for a legacy (non-1C) account/site 
 *  When they log or review inventory data 
 *  Then the app must behave exactly as it does today, with no regression in experience or data linkage. 
 

 *  Scenario 5 – Merged Site/Assets 

 *  Given multiple Sold-To accounts previously referenced the same site and are merged under 1C 
 *  When a user accesses the Inventory Control App for that site 
 *  Then all related inventory records must remain linked and viewable without duplication or broken references.

836355,Requirement,,,,,30. Ensure Continuity and Data Accuracy in CIPPC and Concentration Check Apps Post Account Merge,,,,"Business Objective
The CIPPC and Concentration Check Apps are critical tools embedded within service visit forms, enabling field representatives to log chemical concentration readings at the site level during visits. With the upcoming One Customer model implementation, which introduces merged Sold-To accounts and consolidated site structures, it is essential to ensure that these apps continue to function without disruption. Business users must retain visibility only to the relevant data they are authorized to view, while historical data accuracy and ownership must be preserved. The goal is to avoid any data duplication, access issues, or visibility gaps that may arise due to account or site merges. 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  The CIPPC and Concentration Check apps must remain fully functional for all users post-account merge, regardless of whether an account follows the legacy structure or the new One Customer model. 
 *  App data must remain linked to the correct site or asset and reflect proper ownership throughout and after Sold-To account merges. 
 *  Existing security and visibility logic must be maintained. Sales reps should continue to see only data tied to accounts and sites they are aligned to via CRM security roles. 
 *  In scenarios where multiple Sold-To accounts previously referenced the same site (and are now merged), the system must ensure that duplicate CIPPC records are not created and historical data remains accurate and non-overlapping. 
 *  No changes should be made to the app UI or forms; the experience must remain consistent for end users. 
 *  Ownership history and record visibility for CIPPC and Concentration Check records must be retained accurately even after account or site merges. 
 *  The app should continue to support backward compatibility, functioning identically for accounts that are not yet migrated to the One Customer structure. 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Conduct a thorough regression testing effort focused on CIPPC and Concentration Check functionality post-site and Sold-To merges. 
 *  Confirm that data migration activities do not introduce duplicate readings, orphaned records, or broken links to service visits or assets. 
 *  Validate that record ownership, security roles, and visibility scoping remain accurate post-merge, based on the existing CRM security model. 
 *  No changes are expected to UI components, data models, or integration logic of the CIPPC and Concentration Check apps. 
 *  Validate that the app continues to pull and sync data seamlessly with CRM even in merged-account scenarios. 
 *  Validate deduplication logic where applicable, especially for sites shared between multiple historical Sold-To accounts. 
 *  Ensure that service visit associations are preserved correctly in merged structures and no functional issues arise. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Regression test results validating full app functionality for both merged and legacy account structures. 
 *  Confirmation that ownership, data integrity, and security roles are intact and no visibility gaps exist. 
 *  Validation report confirming no duplicate records were introduced during Sold-To or site merges. 
 *  Test scenarios covering both One Customer accounts and non-converted legacy accounts. 
 *  Documentation confirming continued backward compatibility and no changes to UI or core logic.

836349,Feature,,,,CRM: Power Apps Hub Enablement for Unified Account Model and ERP Transition Handling,,,,,"This feature addresses required updates and validations to the Ecolab Power Apps Hub, ensuring its continued effectiveness and reliability following the rollout of the One Customer unified account model in CRM and the transition from SAP to EBS as the ERP system. The Hub is a centralized field sales and service portal that relies entirely on real-time CRM data, deep links, and CRM-based security roles. It does not maintain independent data or logic, making it highly sensitive to CRM structural and integration changes.

 
With the introduction of Base Customer Account (BCA) as a read-only entity in CRM, and the transition to Sold-To accounts in EBS without SHIP-TOs, several updates are required to preserve usability, data integrity, and feature availability in the Hub:
 

 *  Account structure changes require regression testing and revalidation of record visibility, views, and deep linking. 
 *  Notification flows triggered via Power Automate must be audited and optimized to align with the new ERP segmentation and account hierarchy. 
 *  Order tracking and ERP-specific logic within the Hub must be decoupled from SHIP-TO-based ERP detection, particularly when standalone tracking is accessed without a parent account. 
 *  ERP-aware UI behavior is needed to hide or disable SAP-only features for EBS-aligned accounts. 
 *  Security and access configurations must ensure users aligned to one business (e.g., F&B) are not able to access legacy NALCO-only tiles or workflows and vice versa. 
 

 
This feature ensures the Hub remains backward compatible with legacy SAP scenarios, while fully supporting merged and future-state accounts under the unified CRM model and EBS ERP landscape. It also sets the foundation for long-term maintenance and governance of the Hub user experience as business systems converge.

836354,Requirement,,,,,29. Hub Core Transaction Functions and Regression Validation for FB United 1C Accounts,,,,"Business Objective
 
 
To ensure Hub core transaction functions (account creation, opportunity creation, TSR creation, and team member ID access) continue to work seamlessly for FB United 1C accounts. Where changes are required (e.g., account creation sales skill field), they must align with the new One Customer data model, while other functions (opportunity, TSR, team member ID) require regression validation to confirm stability. 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Account Creation 

 *  Allow Hub users to create new prospect accounts for FB United 1C districts. 
 *  Add Sales Skill field to account creation forms in Hub. 
 *  Default Sales Skill automatically from the logged-in user profile when available. 
 *  For users not aligned to a Sales Skill (e.g., DM, BDM, ITC), present a drop-down list of available Sales Skills from the district-to-sales skill mapping. 
 *  Ensure all minimum required fields align with CRM requirements. 
 

 *  Opportunity Creation 

 *  Hub users should continue to create opportunities against FB United 1C accounts as they do today. 
 *  No changes to existing opportunity creation rules or ownership flows. 
 *  Regression validation only; confirm opportunities save and sync correctly with CRM. 
 

 *  TSR Creation 

 *  Hub users should continue to create TSRs against FB United 1C accounts without changes to the process. 
 *  Regression validation only; confirm TSRs follow existing creation and submission rules. 
 

 *  Team Member ID Access 

 *  Hub users should continue to access Team Member ID from the Site tile for FB United 1C accounts. 
 *  Must display all sales reps and CAMs across all sales skills aligned to the account. 
 *  Regression validation only within Hub, since the underlying API may require separate enhancements on the data side. 
 

 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Account Creation 

 *  Ensure Hub forms are updated to include the Sales Skill field and link to CRM’s district-to-sales skill mapping. 
 *  Implement defaulting logic for Sales Skill based on user profile; provide fallback drop-down when default is not available. 
 

 *  Opportunity / TSR Creation 

 *  No schema or form changes required; validate existing API/data connections still work post–1C migration. 
 *  Regression testing to confirm seamless behavior with CRM. 
 

 *  Team Member ID 

 *  Regression validation in Hub only. 
 *  Ensure Hub consumes the updated API response that includes sales reps and CAMs across multiple sales skills for FB United 1C accounts. 
 *  No new Hub-side development required unless regression testing identifies issues. 
 

 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Updated Hub account creation form with Sales Skill field logic implemented (default + drop-down). 
 *  Regression test results for opportunity creation, TSR creation, and team member ID access for FB United 1C accounts. 
 *  Confirmation that Hub aligns with CRM rules for required fields, sales skill assignment, and account ownership. 
 *  Updated regression test scripts covering all four functions (account, opportunity, TSR, team member ID). 
 *  Final sign-off from business confirming no functional gaps for FB United 1C core transactions.

 *  Given I attempt to save an account in a FB United 1C district without a Sales Skill selected, 

 *  When I click Save, 
 *  Then I should receive an error preventing the save until Sales Skill is provided. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Sales Skill field must be added to Hub account creation for FB United 1C districts only. 
 *  Sales Skill should default from user profile if available; otherwise, allow manual selection from district-to-sales skill mapping. 
 *  Global Business field must be hidden for 1C accounts and derived automatically from Sales Skill. 
 *  Existing required fields in Hub account creation should remain unchanged. 
 *  Validation must prevent saving an account without a Sales Skill for 1C districts. 
 *  Non-1C district account creation process must remain unaffected.

836353,Requirement,,,,,28. Deactivate Outdated Hub Notifications for FB United 1C Cutover,,,,"Business Objective
 
 
Ensure Hub users only receive valid and actionable notifications after the FB United 1C cutover. Any notifications tied to deactivated, merged, or migrated records (e.g., legacy NSAP billing arrangements, merged SOWs, or closed escalations) must be deactivated so users are not confused by outdated alerts. By proactively cleaning up these notifications, we maintain trust in Hub alerts and prevent unnecessary rework.

 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Deactivate notifications tied to Scopes of Work once inactive or merged. 
 *  Deactivate notifications tied to Service Plans once inactive or merged. 
 *  Deactivate notifications tied to legacy NSAP Billing Arrangements when migrated to EBS. 
 *  Deactivate notifications tied to open Order Escalations at cutover. 
 *  Retain deactivated notifications for 30 days for fallback, then allow the system job to delete. 
 *  Validate that no new notifications are generated for inactive or migrated records post-cutover. 
 *  Regression-only validation required for notifications where no system change is needed (Opportunities, TSRs, Order Tracking). 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Hub notifications live in CRM’s Hub Notifications table, linked to entities like opportunities, accounts, billing arrangements, and service plans. 
 *  Nightly notification jobs must reference only active records; deactivation ensures orphaned notifications are excluded. 
 *  Deactivation should be triggered as part of cutover/migration events (e.g., NSAP ? EBS billing arrangement switch). 
 *  Standard practice: deactivate ? retain 30 days ? auto-delete. 
 *  Must align notification clean-up timing with EBS migration milestones. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Notification deactivation rules configured for SOW, Service Plans, Billing Arrangements, and Order Escalations. 
 *  Consolidated regression test results proving Opportunities, TSRs, and Order Tracking notifications continue to work as expected. 
 *  Documented deactivation process for support and fallback. 
 *  Updated functional and technical design docs reflecting deactivation scope.

 *  Given opportunity notifications (e.g., reminders at 0, 5, and 15 days before estimated close), 

 *  When opportunities remain active in CRM after cutover, 
 *  Then Hub must continue generating and managing these notifications as it does today. 
 

 *  Given TSR (Technical Service Request) notifications exist in CRM, 

 *  When TSRs are created, updated, or awaiting approval, 
 *  Then the corresponding Hub notifications must still be triggered and deactivated according to current rules. 
 

 *  Given order tracking notifications exist (ETA changes, credit/pricing issues), 

 *  When the nightly order tracking jobs run post-cutover, 
 *  Then Hub must generate these notifications exactly as in the pre-cutover state, without regression. 
 

 *  Given no changes are planned for opportunity, TSR, or order tracking logic, 

 *  When regression testing is performed, 
 *  Then testers must confirm that notification generation, deactivation, and deletion lifecycle remain unchanged. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  No build changes are required for opportunity, TSR, or order tracking notifications. 
 *  Regression testing must validate that: 

 *  Opportunities: Notification triggers and deactivation rules work as-is. 
 *  TSRs: Approval and status-change notifications are unaffected by cutover. 
 *  Order Tracking: ETA and credit/pricing issue notifications continue to work for both NSAP and EBS accounts. 
 

 *  QA teams must build regression test scripts covering each notification type to ensure no unintended impacts.

836352,Requirement,,,,,27. Hub Order Tracking Alignment with ERP Systems,,,,"Business Objective
 
 
 
 
To ensure Hub users can reliably view order tracking details regardless of whether the underlying account is managed in SAP, EBS, or FB United 1C (EBS-driven) systems. The goal is to harmonize order tracking logic in the Hub so that ERP differences do not cause confusion, gaps, or incorrect information for users managing their customer orders.
on correctly post-merge. Any issues identified during validation should be addressed appropriately to maintain seamless user experience.
 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Hub must align order tracking logic to use the ERP System field on the account to determine whether to use SAP or EBS order APIs. 
 *  For FB United 1C accounts: 

 *  Use EBS Ship-To accounts for assembling the order tracking payload. 
 *  Replace legacy logic (which relied on customer account details for SAP). 
 

 *  Ensure order tracking details display consistently across: 

 *  Account Details view (user sees orders tied to that account’s Ship-To). 
 *  My Territory view (user sees orders for accounts where they are the primary owner, team member, or for accounts marked as favorites). 
 

 *  Logic should correctly differentiate Water vs Hygiene sales skills under a single customer (1C scenario). 
 *  Hub must support orders for: 

 *  Recently delivered orders, 
 *  Upcoming deliveries, 
 *  Credit block orders. 
 

 *  Favorite accounts must continue to display order tracking across multiple ERP systems (EBS and SAP). 
 *  Ensure no disruption to current SAP order tracking while adding EBS support. 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Hub must check the ERP System flag on accounts in CRM to route order tracking API calls appropriately. 
 *  For FB United 1C, Hub should: 

 *  Use EBS Ship-To data structures (provided via CRM ? EBS sync). 
 *  Assemble order tracking payloads using EBS Ship-To IDs instead of legacy customer-level IDs. 
 

 *  Adjust My Territory order tracking logic to reference EBS Ship-To accounts when ERP system = EBS. 
 *  Support hybrid/favorite accounts where orders may need to be pulled from both ERP sources. 
 *  Possible dependency on Billing Arrangement redesign (if BA types affect order visibility).  
 *  Regression testing needed for order tracking APIs (SAP and EBS). 
 

 

 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Updated Hub logic to use ERP System field to determine order tracking payload assembly. 
 *  Correct order tracking data displayed for: 

 *  Account detail view (per-account orders). 
 *  My Territory view (primary owner/team member/favorites). 
 

 *  Harmonized order tracking for FB United 1C customers using EBS Ship-To records. 
 *  Regression-tested Hub integration with both SAP and EBS order tracking APIs. 
 *  Documentation of new logic and validation with Sales Ops and business stakeholders.

856122,User Story,,,,,,Technical Spike: Investigate and Document ERP-aligned Order Tracking logic for Hub (FB United 1C),,,"As a technical architect, I need to investigate how Hub should assemble and route order-tracking API requests for FB United 1C accounts (vs. non-1C), so that we can define a single, correct approach for account details and My Territory views (self, team, favorites) that uses EBS SHIP-TOs when appropriate and preserves current behavior for NSAP/non-1C—enabling accurate orders, ETA, credit/pricing alerts, and consistent UX.

 
Background:
 
Today Hub builds order-tracking payloads differently for NSAP vs. EBS. With FB United 1C, CRM will hide SHIP-TO on UI but still store/maintain EBS SHIP-TOs. Hub must:
 

 *  Detect the ERP system per account and switch logic accordingly. 
 *  Use EBS SHIP-TOs for FB United 1C flows (account details + territory views) and keep existing NSAP behavior for non-1C. 
 *  Keep favorite/team/ITC scenarios working across mixed ERP footprints. 
 *  This spike defines the authoritative design and artifacts that downstream stories will implement. 
 

 

","Rajesh, Gumma",PO Approved,GVID/HUB,\FBU 1C\Hub,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.05,2,Moved out of state Pending PO Review,Business,7," *  Functional/Logic Investigation 

 *  Document decision matrix for payload construction: 

 *  Inputs: ERP System (NSAP/EBS), Account Type (customer/prospect), FB United 1C flag, View context (Account Details / My Territory – Me / Team / Favorites). 
 *  Outputs: Account identifiers to use in the API (sold-to vs. SHIP-TO list), batching/limits, and fallback behavior. 
 

 *  Define how Hub detects ERP per account (field source, precedence, edge cases after merges). 
 *  Confirm which SHIP-TOs Hub must include for EBS (primary, all active, filtered by ownership/region?) and how to retrieve/cache them. 
 *  Specify behavior for mixed portfolios (user has NSAP & EBS accounts/favorites simultaneously). 
 *  Determine whether SHIP-TO/BA tiles are shown/hidden in Hub for FB United 1C, and any placeholder text if hidden. 
 

 *  Data & Integration Mapping 

 *  Map the data sources (CRM entities/fields, Snowflake views, APIs) needed to: 
 *  Resolve ERP system & FB United 1C flag. 
 *  Retrieve EBS SHIP-TOs tied to the account. 
 *  Build My Territory lists (self, team, favorites) with correct identifiers. 
 

 *  Define identifier mapping (sold-to, ship-to, account GUIDs, any legacy IDs) and normalization rules. 

 *  UX/Behavior Specs (implementation-ready) 
 *  For Account Details: exact conditions to call order API and which identifiers to send by ERP. 
 *  For My Territory – Me/Team/Favorites: rules for assembling account sets and mapping to API payloads by ERP. 
 *  Rules for empty states (no SHIP-TOs, no recent orders) and mixed-ERP messaging.

","Rajesh, Gumma",PO Approved,GVID/HUB,\FBU 1C\Hub,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.05,2,Moved out of state Pending PO Review,Business,8,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 
 

 *  Display Orders for Team Member Accounts 

 *  Given I am logged into the Hub, 
 *  When I open the Order Tracking – My Territory view and select a team member that's aligned to an FBU1C district,  
 *  Then I should see order tracking details for all SHIP-TO accounts where a team member aligned to me is listed as the primary owner. 
 

 *  FB United 1C Logic (ERP-driven) 

 *  Given I am a Hub user  
 *  When I request order tracking for a team member aligned with an FB United 1C district, 
 *  Then the system should always use the EBS SHIP-TO logic for retrieving order details. 
 

 *  Non-1C Logic (No Change) 

 *  Given I am a Hub user aligned with a non-1C district, 
 *  When I request order tracking for team member accounts, 
 *  Then the system should continue using the current ERP-specific logic (NALCO Water ? SHIP-TO details, F&B ? customer account details). 
 

 *  Consolidated Territory View (I'm not quite sure what this is - we don't have a single view of orders across multiple territories. Orders are only viewed one primary owner at a time.)  

 *  Given I view My Territory data,  
 *  When order details are retrieved,  
 *  Then both my accounts and my team members’ accounts must appear in one consolidated list.  
 

 *  Data Accuracy 

 *  Given order details are displayed, 
 *  When I drill into an order, 
 *  Then the account, SHIP-TO, owner (team member), and ERP system references must be accurate and consistent with backend order data. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Extend order tracking visibility to include SHIP-TO accounts where a team member is the primary owner. 
 *  For FB United 1C accounts, enforce EBS SHIP-TO logic for order retrieval. 
 *  For non-1C accounts, retain current ERP-specific logic (NALCO Water ? SHIP-TO, F&B ? customer account). 
 *  Display results for my accounts + team member accounts in one consolidated view. 
 *  Ensure the ownership field clearly identifies which team member is the primary owner for each order. (This would be a new requirement - we don't show per-order ownership. The team member is selected in the top filter then all orders are aligned to the selected team member.) 
 *  Maintain parity of displayed fields with the standard Order Tracking view (order number, product, ETA/delivery date, SHIP-TO, status). 
 *  Validate data through regression testing for both 1C and non-1C districts.

 *  EBS / FB United 1C Customers 

 *  Given I am a Hub user viewing an Account Details screen for an account with ERP system = EBS and flagged as FB United 1C, 
 *  When I request order tracking details, 
 *  Then the system must build the order tracking API payload using EBS SHIP-TO identifiers, and return order status (recent deliveries, upcoming deliveries, credit issues) tied to those SHIP-TOs.

 *  Given I am a Hub user viewing an Account Details screen for an account with ERP system = NSAP or not flagged as FB United 1C,

 *  Then I should see a consistent UI layout (order list with ETA, delivery status, credit flags) regardless of ERP system, but the backend logic is ERP-driven.

 *  ERP system field drives the logic: 

 *  EBS (FB United 1C): Use SHIP-TO identifiers from CRM/EBS integration. 
 *  NSAP/non-1C: Continue current state using customer account identifiers. 
 

 *  Order tracking details should include: 

 *  Recent deliveries. 
 *  Upcoming deliveries. 
 *  Credit or pricing block flags. 
 

 *  UI consistency: Users should see the same order-tracking layout regardless of ERP source. 
 *  SHIP-TO visibility rule: SHIP-TOs hidden in CRM remain hidden in Hub UI; however, the backend payloads must still leverage them. 
 *  Support mixed ERP portfolios: Users with accounts across both ERP systems should see correct tracking per account type. 
 *  No regression: Ensure that order tracking for NSAP/non-1C continues to work exactly as before.

836351,Requirement,,,,,26. Enhance Hub Experience with Clear Sales Skill Visibility and Ability to Manage Sales Skills for FBUnited1C Customers,,,,"Business Objective
 
 
Today, Hub users cannot easily distinguish whether they are working with a Water or Hygiene account, nor can they manage sales skill associations directly within the Hub. With the transition to the FBUnited1C model, both Water and Hygiene sales skill accounts may exist under the same customer number. Business users need clear visibility of sales skills in all Hub screens and the ability to add sales skills when missing. This will ensure accurate account selection, reduce confusion, and allow seamless management of customer business across divisions. 

 *  Background: Currently our HUB account list and account details screens show Account Name, Number, Account Type, Address, and the account ownership. In order for user to get to the right account or confirm they're on the right account, we'll need to add Sales Skill to each of these places within the mobile and desktop apps. 
 *  Current State: Examples:
  
 

 

[Image] 

 
  
 

 *  Future State: Sales Skill will need to be indicated in each of these places. 
 


 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Sales Skill Visibility 

 *  Display sales skill information on the account list screen so users can differentiate accounts. 
 *  Display sales skill on the account details screen for each FBUnited1C customer. 
 *  Show sales skill on the Hub desktop home screen within the favorite accounts section. 
 

 *  Sales Skill Management 

 *  Enable users to add a new sales skill for an FBUnited1C customer directly from the Hub. 
 *  Align add sales skill functionality with CRM logic so Hub actions trigger the correct CRM/CLM processes. 
 

 *  Consistency Across Devices 

 *  Ensure visibility and management features are consistent across Hub mobile and desktop apps. 
 

 *  Ease of Use 

 *  Clearly differentiate between Water and Hygiene when multiple sales skills exist under one customer. 
 *  Prevent confusion or duplication by mirroring CRM’s validation rules and restrictions. 
 

 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Requires updates to Hub UI components on account list, account details, and favorites sections. 
 *  Integration with CRM must ensure sales skill values are accurate and synchronized. 
 *  “Add Sales Skill” action in Hub should invoke the same backend services or APIs used in CRM for sales skill creation. 
 *  Hub logic must align with FBUnited1C district rules — only accounts flagged as FBUnited1C should display these new fields and options. 
 *  Regression testing is needed to confirm no impact on non-FBUnited1C accounts. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Updated Hub account list, account details, and home screens with visible sales skill fields. 
 *  Working “Add Sales Skill” action from Hub, fully integrated with CRM/CLM workflows. 
 *  End-to-end tested flow showing sales skills synced between Hub and CRM for FBUnited1C customers. 
 *  Updated training and user guidance to help reps and managers adopt the new visibility and management process.

","Rajesh, Gumma",PO Approved,GVID/HUB,\FBU 1C\Hub,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.05,2,Moved out of state Pending PO Review,Business,21,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 
 
 
 

 *  Button Visibility – 1C Only 

 *  Given I open a Sales Skill account of type Prospect or Customer from the Hub, 
 *  When the district is flagged as 1C = Yes, 
 *  Then I should see the “Add Sales Skill” button in the command bar or form actions. 
 *  And if both Water and Hygiene Sales Skill accounts are already linked to the BCA, 
 *  Then the button must be hidden. 
 *  And for non-1C districts, the button must never be visible. 
 

 *  Dialog Launch & Owner Selection 

 *  Given I click the “Add Sales Skill” button, 
 *  When the dialog opens, 
 *  And it must display a dropdown of potential owners: 

 *  Default = logged-in user. 
 *  Filtered list = all users in the related district team ( to which customer is aligned) + North America BDMs. Reps should only see the District Team members in the Dropdowns. Only BDM's should be able to see the BDM's in the Drop Downs along with the District Team members 
 *  Search must be supported. 
 

 

 *  Dialog Options 

 *  Given the dialog is open, 
 *  When I select an owner and click Submit, 
 *  Then the system must automatically open the new record in a full CRM form view, showing the cloned data with the newly set ownership and Sales Skill. 
 *  When I click Cancel, 
 *  Then no action is taken and the dialog closes. 
 

 

 *  Prepopulation of Fields 

 *  Given I click on the “Add Sales Skill” option for a 1C customer, 
 *  When the new sales skill creation form opens in the Hub, 
 *  Then all fields from the original account should be copied and pre-populated (account name, address, ownership, district, etc.).

836350,Requirement,,,,,25. Enhance GVID TVD Program Creation to Support Sales Skill Visibility and Filtering,,,,"Business Objective
 
 
 
 
To ensure users creating TVD (Total Value Delivered) programs in GVID can clearly identify and select the correct customer account when multiple sales skills (Water, Hygiene) are associated with the same Sold-To. Additionally, users must be able to filter projects by business unit or market segment after FBUnited1C changes so that TVD programs are aligned with the right type of business. This prevents errors, ensures accurate program attribution, and simplifies the user experience.

 
Business Requirements 

 *  When creating a TVD program in GVID, users must see both the Sold-To account details and its associated Sales Skill (e.g., Water or Hygiene) to distinguish between accounts with the same number. 
 *  The Sales Skill field must be displayed alongside account name and number during Sold-To selection. 
 *  Users must be able to filter recommended projects in GVID by Business Unit (BU) or Market Segment after FBUnited1C changes. 
 *  Filtering must ensure that only relevant projects tied to the selected Sales Skill/BU are displayed for program creation. 
 *  Logic should work seamlessly whether the TVD program is created from: 

 *  Marketer recommendations 
 *  Predictive recommendations 
 

 *  Current user flows (site-level TVD creation) should remain familiar, with enhancements layered in to reduce confusion. 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Investigate how GVID currently retrieves customer business unit information via Market Segment and identify gaps post-FBUnited1C changes. 
 *  A technical spike is required to confirm whether current BU/Market Segment logic can support new 1C structures or if new APIs/fields are needed. 
 *  Ensure consistency with CRM data model changes for Sales Skill and Sold-To alignment. 
 *  Validate downstream impact to reporting and ensure Snowflake/Power BI references reflect the enhanced logic. 
 *  Consider performance impacts when displaying multiple sales skill accounts tied to the same site during Sold-To selection. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Updated GVID UI to display Sales Skill alongside Sold-To account during TVD program creation. 
 *  Enhanced filtering capability in GVID to allow selection by Business Unit or Market Segment post-FBUnited1C. 
 *  Technical spike results documented with clear recommendations for filtering logic updates. 
 *  Updated functional design document outlining user flows for: 

 *  Standard TVD program creation 
 *  Sales Skill differentiation 
 *  BU/Market Segment filtering 
 

 *  Validation and testing to confirm correct program attribution when multiple sales skills exist.

856025,User Story,,,,,,Update Filtering Logic for BU / Market Segment in TVD Program Creation (post-spike outcome),,,"As a GVID user creating or reviewing TVD programs for FBUnited1C sites,

 *  Given I am a GVID user at an FBUnited1C site linked to multiple customers with multiple sales skills, 

 *  When I apply BU/Market Segment filters, 
 *  Then I should only see projects aligned with the chosen sales skill and market segment. 
 

 *  Given I am at a site with only one sales skill, 

 *  When I apply BU/Market Segment filters,  
 *  Then I should see all projects without unnecessary duplication or filtering errors.  
 *  When I view the list of filter options,
 
 *  Then the business unit filter should be disabled should have only one option 
 

 *  Given the technical spike delivers updated logic recommendations, 

 *  When this story is implemented, 
 *  Then the new filtering logic must match the design documented in the spike. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Ensure that BU/Market Segment filtering logic is updated to support FBUnited1C scenarios. 
 *  Filtering must accommodate sites with multiple sales skills (Water + Hygiene). 
 *  Filtering must continue to work seamlessly for sites with only one sales skill. 
 *  End users must not experience duplicate projects or incorrect filtering outcomes. 
 *  All updates must align with the mappings and data structures identified in the technical spike. 
 

 
Notes: 

 *  The “how” (data source, logic implementation, technical dependencies) will be finalized based on the outcome of the technical spike. 
 *  Placeholder acceptance criteria will be updated once the spike deliverables are approved by the solution architect.

856024,User Story,,,,,,Technical Spike – Investigate BU / Market Segment Filtering Logic Post-FBUnited1C,,,"As a GVID user,
 
When I filter recommended projects at a site that has customers across multiple business units (e.g., Water and Hygiene),
 
I need the filtering logic to correctly reflect the new FBUnited1C account and sales skill structure,
 
So that I can filter projects by business type accurately after the transition.
 

 
Current State: 

 *  Filtering logic in GVID relies on market segment values tied to the global business field. 
 *  This approach works when each site is tied to a single business unit. since Nalco Water market segment values are tied to the Nalco Water ""Light"" business unit. With FBU1C changes that may not be the case.  
 *  However, for FBUnited1C sites, a single site may now have both Water and Hygiene customers under different sales skills.  (Our current logic handles this scenario. For sites tied to both Water and Hygiene customers, today GVID would show project types for both businesses. The filter functionality allows users to restrict results to just one business if they only want to see only Water-related or Hygiene-related recommendations. But to know whether we should show the filter, we need to determine all of the Businesses represented by the associated customer accounts.) 
 *  Using only global the market segment business unit for filtering will may not differentiate correctly in these cases.  
 

 
Future State (Target):
 

 *  Filtering logic should leverage the new district-to-sales skill and market segment-to-sales skill mappings. (TBD if this is the correct approach. Technical spike will determine how best to adapt filter logic) 
 *  Users should be able to filter recommended projects cleanly by sales skill/business unit at a site that may host multiple sales skills. 
 *  Any new logic must remain aligned with CRM/MDM master data. 
 

 

","Lanz, Tom",PO Approved,GVID/HUB,\FBU 1C\Hub,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.05,2,Moved out of state Pending PO Review,Business,6," *  Investigate and document: 

 *  How current BU/market segment filtering logic works in GVID. 
 *  How sales skill data is stored and retrieved for FBUnited1C accounts. 
 *  The dependencies on CRM, MDM, and Snowflake views (if any). 
 

 *  Propose a future-state filtering approach that accommodates multiple sales skills per site. 

 *  Define whether filtering should be driven by: 
 *  Sales skill ? market segment mapping (preferred), or 
 *  Another mechanism (if identified during investigation). 
 

 *  Document data flow impacts and confirm feasibility with CRM/MDM data models. 

 *  Provide updated logic flow and recommendations in a design note. 
 *  Deliverables must be reviewed and approved by the Solution Architect.

834305,Feature,,,,CRM: Opportunity Field Harmonization and Unified Experience across sales skills,,,,,"This feature ensures consistent and harmonized opportunity management across all Sales Skills (Water, Hygiene, etc.) within the CRM system by aligning required fields, data entry logic, and notification rules. Currently, opportunity records vary in field requirements, validation stages, and user experience between different Sales Skills, leading to confusion, incomplete data, and misaligned reporting.
 

 
Key components of this feature include:
 

 *  Standardization of mandatory fields across Water and Hygiene Sales Skill opportunities, such as: 

 *  Win Probability 
 *  Estimated Revenue 
 *  Estimated Close Date 
 *  Innovation/Technology indicators 
 *  Opportunity Type and Product Line 
 

 *  Stage-based enforcement of required fields (e.g., certain fields becoming mandatory at Qualify, Develop, or Propose stages) to guide sales users through a consistent progression path and reduce incomplete or non-actionable opportunities. 
 *  Unified business rules and validation logic regardless of Sales Skill, while still preserving any field values that are unique to a specific product line. 
 *  Elimination of redundant or inconsistent field configurations by leveraging a centralized opportunity form structure that supports both Sales Skills, with conditional logic where necessary. 
 *  Harmonization of email notification logic to ensure both Water and Hygiene follow consistent trigger rules—for example, sending alerts for Closed/Won opportunities above a specified revenue threshold or triggering RTW (Retain to Win) notifications based on lost opportunity scenarios. 
 *  Security and user experience improvements to ensure all account-aligned users (e.g., AMs, DMs, CAMs, BDMs) have the correct level of access to create, edit, and view opportunity records across both GTW (Grow to Win) and RTW use cases. 
 

 
This harmonization is a foundational step in supporting the One Customer model, enabling a unified and scalable opportunity management experience across all Sales Skills, and paving the way for better analytics, automation, and cross-sell tracking.

836212,Requirement,,,,,17. Enable Consistent Availability and Regression Validation of Opportunity Accelerator and Team Member Features Across Sales Skills,,,,"Business Capability Overview
Opportunity Team Members and Opportunity Accelerators are both existing CRM features used to capture participants involved in an opportunity. Their usage patterns differ across divisions: Water frequently uses Opportunity Accelerators to involve cross-functional SMEs, while Hygiene typically does not. However, both features must remain consistently available to all users, regardless of sales skill, without any conditional show/hide logic or differentiated UI experience. 

 
This requirement ensures the features are exposed uniformly in the CRM UI, enabling each division to continue using the functionality they need without disrupting the other — while preserving process fidelity and enterprise capability. 

 
Maintain consistent availability of the Opportunity Accelerator and Team Member features across Water and Hygiene sales skills without altering current business behavior. Ensure users in both divisions have visibility and access to both features, even if one is not used by default. Prevent conditional logic that customizes or hides features by sales skill. Execute comprehensive regression testing to confirm no loss of functionality or unexpected side effects from the One Customer changes. 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Do not introduce conditional logic (e.g., dynamic show/hide) for Opportunity Accelerators or Team Members based on sales skill. 
 *  Both Water and Hygiene sales reps must continue to see and access both components on the opportunity form. 
 *  Preserve existing business behavior — no harmonization of process is intended. 
 *  Ensure any opportunity-related enhancements under the One Customer initiative do not negatively impact usage of these features. 
 *  Execute comprehensive regression test scenarios to confirm: 
 *  Records can be created and edited with either or both contributor types. 
 *  Security roles (AM, DM, CAM, PDM, etc.) retain correct access. 
 *  Reporting logic and compensation workflows tied to these contributors remain functional. 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Validate form layout includes both Opportunity Team Member and Accelerator components for all opportunity records. 
 *  Confirm that business rules or JavaScript logic does not prevent display or editing of these components in either Water or Hygiene contexts. 
 *  Evaluate current role-based access — ensure all necessary personas (sales, managers, SMEs) retain appropriate CRUD permissions. 
 *  If there is logic impacting visibility or lookup filtering based on sales skill, it must be neutralized. 
 *  Regression testing should include creation, update, and reporting validations for both components. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Updated opportunity forms with consistent and unfiltered display of both features. 
 *  Regression test plans and execution results validating no behavioral changes in Water or Hygiene. 
 *  Confirmation of access and edit rights for all relevant security roles. 
 *  Validation that reporting pipelines and downstream data flows (e.g., compensation, dashboards) continue to work as before. 
 *  No development changes to behavior or business rules unless required for bug fixes uncovered during regression.

836211,Requirement,,,,,16. Harmonize Opportunity Management Across Water and Hygiene Sales Skills,,,,"Business Capability Overview
Opportunity management workflows in CRM differ between Water and Hygiene sales divisions today. These inconsistencies include varied required fields, form behaviors, and role-specific access controls. This lack of standardization leads to confusion for users, fragmented reporting, and increased system maintenance effort. As part of the One Customer initiative, this requirement aims to align the opportunity creation and tracking experience across sales skills to ensure a unified, scalable sales process. 

 
Business Objective 
Deliver a consistent and harmonized opportunity experience in CRM for all divisions — enabling AMs, DMs, CAMs, and PDMs to collaborate and manage deals more effectively. The unified experience should eliminate confusion caused by sales-skill-specific logic, reduce the need for custom code, and improve end-to-end pipeline visibility across Water and Hygiene businesses. 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Consolidate Water and Hygiene opportunity forms into a single harmonized form with consistent layout, logic, and validations. 
 *  Ensure the same fields are presented to users across all sales skill types with no dynamic hiding or conditional display logic based on sales skill. 
 *  Align required fields, validations, and business rules across all Opportunity BPF stages, especially during Qualify and Develop. 
 *  Enforce common user experience and security behavior across roles such as Account Managers, District Managers, CAMs, and PDMs. 
 *  The following fields were discussed during the workshop as potential candidates for harmonization: 

 *  Win Probability 
 *  Estimated Revenue 
 *  Estimated Close Date 
 *  Innovation/Technology Platform Indicator 
 *  Opportunity Type 
 *  Product Line 
 

 *  Additional fields or rules may also require harmonization. The exact field list and business logic will be provided by the business team as part of their ongoing harmonization analysis. Implementation and prioritization will occur only after the finalized list is received from business. 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Unify opportunity forms and remove duplicate forms by division. 
 *  Refactor or eliminate JavaScript logic currently used to show/hide fields based on sales skill. 
 *  Update BPF stages and required field logic based on the finalized business-aligned harmonization list. 
 *  Update field-level security roles and user access based on harmonized design. 
 *  Conduct full regression testing for existing automation and workflows tied to opportunity records. 
 *  Validate any downstream impact on Power BI, dashboards, reporting views, and external integrations. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  One harmonized opportunity form for all sales skill accounts. 
 *  Updated field requirement logic and validations per unified business process. 
 *  Updated BPF stages and harmonized experience across both divisions. 
 *  Revised user security and access rules per role. 
 *  Updated views, filters, and dashboards to support unified reporting. 
 *  Regression-tested automation and process flows. 
 *  Documentation of changes and business sign-off post-delivery.

836357,Feature,,,,CRM: Enable CRM Reporting Alignment for One Customer via Snowflake View Enhancements,,,,,"This feature focuses on updating CRM-sourced Snowflake Views to support the new One Customer account structure, specifically the introduction of Base Customer Account (BCA) and Sales Skill fields. These enhancements will enable downstream reporting teams, including Power BI users, to accurately filter, group, and analyze customer and sales data under the new consolidated structure.

 
Today, reporting relies on legacy CRM account numbers and district naming conventions (e.g., “FP”) to distinguish Water and Hygiene divisions. These identifiers will no longer be valid post-migration, as multiple legacy accounts will be merged under a single BCA. The new reporting structure must support visibility and aggregation based on BCA ID, BCA Number, BCA Name, and Sales Skill assignments.
 

 
The CRM Development Team will be responsible for:
 

 *  Updating relevant Snowflake Views (e.g., account, user, district) to include new fields supporting the One Customer data model. 
 *  Maintaining backward compatibility by retaining legacy account references where required. 
 *  Coordinating schema changes across Snowflake environments (e.g., regional vs. enterprise instances). 
 *  Supporting a broad communications and documentation effort to ensure BI/reporting teams are informed of schema changes and usage guidelines. 
 

 
While Power BI report changes are not in scope for this release, the CRM team’s ownership of Snowflake View updates is a critical dependency for successful Power BI remediation and long-term reporting alignment.

836358,Requirement,,,,,34. Update CRM-Sourced Snowflake Views to Support One Customer Account and Sales Skill Structure,,,,"Business Objective:
 
 
To enable accurate and consistent reporting in Power BI and downstream analytics tools, CRM data must reflect the new One Customer account structure. This includes surfacing Base Customer Account (BCA) and Sales Skill information in the Snowflake reporting layer so that users can effectively filter, aggregate, and analyze data based on the new organizational model. 

 
Without these updates, reporting will remain reliant on deprecated identifiers (e.g., legacy account numbers, district names like “FP”) that will no longer uniquely or accurately represent accounts after CRM migration.
 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Ensure the Base Customer Account (BCA) entity in CRM is represented in Snowflake as a new view or included in an existing reporting structure. 
 *  Add the following new fields to existing Snowflake Views: 

 *  Account Table: 

 *  BCA ID (reference key) 
 *  BCA Name 
 *  Sales Skill ID (reference key) 
 *  Sales Skill Name 
 *  Lead Division Flag 
 

 *  District Table: 

 *  One Customer (1C) Flag 
 

 *  User Table: 

 *  Sales Skill ID 
 *  Sales Skill Name 
 

 *  Sales Skill table 

 *  Sales Skill Name 
 *  Sales Skill Description 
 *  ERP Sales Skill Code 
 *  Status Code 
 *  Global Business 
 

 *  District Sales Skill N:N Native Relationship Table 

 *  District Name 
 *  District ID 
 *  Sales Skill Name 
 *  Sales Skill ID 
 

 *  Market Segment Sales Skill N:N Native Relationship Table 

 *  Market Segment Name 
 *  Market Segment ID 
 *  Sales Skill Name 
 *  Sales Skill ID 
 

 

 

 *  Maintain backward compatibility by retaining legacy account number references (where necessary) to support transitional reporting. 
 *  Ensure field-level mapping and metadata are aligned with Snowflake schema documentation. 
 *  Follow the established Snowflake view update process coordinated through 5-TRAN, with ownership from Zahara and Siddharth. 
 *  Validate that downstream Power BI teams are made aware of schema changes through formal communication and updated mapping documentation. 
 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  All changes must be implemented via the FiveTran integration layer, which maps CRM tables and fields to Snowflake Views.

834310,Feature,,,,CRM: CRM Retain-to-Win and Lost Business Notification and Access Harmonization,,,,,"This feature focuses on ensuring consistent and reliable handling of Retain-to-Win (RTW), Grow-to-Win (GTW), and Lost Business workflows within CRM, particularly in the context of the unified “One Customer” model. The objective is to harmonize business rules for field usage, notification triggers, and user access across both Water and Hygiene divisions.

 
Currently, workflows for RTW and lost business opportunities are manually entered into CRM by field-aligned users, triggering targeted email notifications to appropriate leadership and sales teams. However, inconsistencies exist between Water and Hygiene in how required fields and email notifications are handled.
 

 
As part of this feature, the following enhancements and validations are in scope:
 

 *  Email Notification Logic Harmonization: Align trigger conditions (e.g., Closed-Won over $10K, RTW submissions) and standardize recipient distribution lists across both Water and Hygiene divisions. Existing rules apply only to Hygiene and must be expanded to cover Water opportunities. 
 *  Security Model Validation: Ensure all relevant CRM roles—AMs, ADMs, DMs, AVPs, CAMs, and CAM Leaders—retain the ability to initiate, edit, and track RTW, GTW, and Lost Business entries. Avoid over-restricting data entry by role to support flexibility in the field. 
 *  Process Continuity in Unified Model: Validate that existing CRM dashboards, views, and Power BI reports continue to function correctly post-BCA implementation for managing RTW and GTW pipelines at the consolidated account level.

834682,Requirement,,,,,36. Validate and Maintain Role-Based Access to RTW and Lost Business Entry Forms under One Customer Structure,,,,"Business Objective:
Ensure that only the appropriate roles across both Water and Hygiene divisions have the ability to create, edit, and view Retain-to-Win (RTW) and Lost Business entries in CRM, even after implementing the new One Customer structure. This will protect data integrity, support frontline ownership, and allow timely visibility for leadership teams without overexposing sensitive risk-related data. 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  RTW and Lost Business forms are currently used by a variety of roles including: 

 *  Account Managers (AMs) 
 *  District Managers (DMs) 
 *  Area Vice Presidents (AVPs) 
 *  Customer Account Managers (CAMs) 
 *  CAM Leaders 
 

 *  All users who are aligned to the account should be able to: 

 *  Create a new RTW or Lost Business record 
 *  View any record submitted for accounts within their territory or assigned accounts 
 

 *  No restrictions should be added based on division (Water vs. Hygiene) — access should be based on account alignment and user role only. 
 *  Users not aligned to the account or role should not be able to create or view RTW/Lost Business records. 
 *  Existing access behavior should be regression-tested under the new Base Customer Account (BCA) structure to ensure: 

 *  Account alignment is respected 
 *  No unintended exposure of records 
 *  Proper visibility across merged accounts 
 

 *  Security roles or team-based access should not require any immediate changes unless regression identifies issues. 
 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  Review and validate existing security roles, field-level security, and record-level access rules related to RTW/Lost Business entities. 
 *  Confirm access behavior works as expected post-migration to 1C structure, especially for accounts with shared Water and Hygiene sales skills. 
 *  Reassess team ownership, user privileges, and security roles for: 

 *  Create, Read, Write, Append, and Append To privileges on RTW and Lost Business records. 
 

 *  Ensure that role-based forms, views, and dashboards continue to show only authorized data per user persona. 
 *  No new role creation or major access model change is expected, but a thorough regression test must be performed. 
 *  Security logic may rely on CRM’s access team templates, hierarchical security, or custom plugins/workflows—each must be reviewed. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Confirmed list of personas and their current access rights to RTW and Lost Business forms. 
 *  Regression test results showing: 

 *  Users aligned to an account can create and view records 
 *  Non-aligned users cannot access these forms or records 
 

 *  Documentation of existing access logic with notes on how it functions under merged BCA accounts. 
 *  Sign-off from business owners confirming that current access model meets One Customer expectations. 
 *  Optional recommendation: Define and publish a matrix showing personas vs. permissions for clarity.

834681,Requirement,,,,,35. Standardize RTW and Lost Business Notification Rules Across Water and Hygiene Sales SKills,,,,"Business Objective:
Ensure consistent and accurate communication of at-risk accounts and lost business events across all divisions (Water and Hygiene) by standardizing the notification logic and email distribution rules within CRM. This supports proactive leadership engagement, timely intervention, and a unified experience under the One Customer model. 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  When a user submits a Retain-to-Win (RTW) or Lost Business entry in CRM, a notification email should be sent automatically to a defined set of recipients. 
 *  Today, this email logic differs across divisions: 

 *  For example, Hygiene has notification rules triggered for deals >$10K, while Water may lack equivalent logic. 
 

 *  The distribution lists and notification criteria must be reviewed and standardized across both Water and Hygiene. 
 *  Business teams (e.g., Tracy, Bri) will need to: 

 *  Define the criteria that trigger notifications (e.g., opportunity stage, value threshold). 
 *  Define the recipients per region or role (e.g., AVPs, CAMs, DMs). 
 

 *  Until these inputs are received, no changes should be implemented. 
 *  CRM should support flexible configuration, so future updates to recipients or logic can be managed with minimal technical effort. 
 *  Once standardized, all RTW and Lost Business entries — regardless of originating division — should trigger a single, unified notification flow. 
 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  The current notification flows must be audited to understand what is implemented for Hygiene and Water. 
 *  If flows are built via Power Automate, plugins, or CRM workflows, their logic and triggers will need to be reviewed and aligned. 
 *  Dynamic distribution lists or email templates may need to be created or reused for better maintainability. 
 *  A technical spike may be required to: 
 *  Inventory current notification logic 
 *  Confirm notification trigger points (on form save, stage change, or field update) 
 *  Analyze whether separate flows exist or if shared ones can be re-used. 
 *  
 
 *  No UI changes are anticipated at this time. 
 *  Ensure no regressions occur for existing business units post-change. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Documented list of current RTW/Lost Business notification flows by division (pre-change baseline). 
 *  Finalized notification rules and recipient lists provided by business. 
 *  Updated logic in CRM to trigger unified notifications upon RTW or Lost Business submission, per agreed rules. 
 *  Regression testing results confirming that: 

 *  Notifications are sent reliably 
 *  No duplicate or missed emails 
 *  No other opportunity flows are broken 
 

 *  Documentation outlining how to maintain and update recipient lists or logic in the future.

865476,User Story,,,,,,Technical Spike – Analyze and Document RTW and Lost Business Notification Processes across Water and Hygiene Divisions,,,"As a technical analyst,
I want to investigate and document the existing RTW (Retain-to-Win) and Lost Business notification logic and configurations across Water and Hygiene divisions in CRM,
 
so that we can identify gaps, differences, and opportunities to standardize the notification and communication process under the One Customer model.
 

 
Background and Rationale: 
Within the current CRM environment, the RTW (Retain-to-Win) and Lost Business notification processes differ significantly between the Water and Hygiene divisions. 

 
For example:
 

 *  Hygiene has established notification rules that trigger email alerts when deals exceed a certain threshold (e.g., $10K), notifying specific distribution lists (e.g., Regional Leaders, BSEs). 
 *  Water, however, may lack equivalent automation or use different thresholds, criteria, and recipient logic. 
 

 
These inconsistencies cause: 

 *  Unequal visibility of at-risk accounts and lost business events across divisions. 
 *  Missed opportunities for proactive leadership intervention and timely customer engagement. 
 *  Confusion among users about which teams are notified and under what conditions. 
 

 
Under the One Customer model, both Water and Hygiene divisions must follow a unified notification framework — ensuring that leadership and sales teams receive consistent, timely, and accurate communications when RTW or Lost Business entries are submitted. 

 
This spike will focus on:
 

 *  Conducting a technical review of CRM workflows, Power Automate flows, plugins, or email alerts related to RTW and Lost Business. 
 *  Identifying and documenting differences in notification logic, criteria, thresholds, and recipients across Water and Hygiene. 
 *  Producing a comparative analysis report highlighting key findings, current behavior, and areas requiring harmonization. 
 *  Preparing inputs for the business team (BSE / Sales Enablement) to define the future standardized notification rules.

857146,Feature,,,,CRM: Corporate Account (H5) Enablement and Global Business Field Remediation,,,,,"This feature introduces the design and remediation work needed to align corporate accounts (H5/Org accounts) under the One Customer (1C) model.

 
Under the new approach:
 

 *  Hygiene H5 accounts will survive as the single corporate account. 
 *  Water H5 accounts will be merged into the Hygiene H5 accounts. 
 *  The Global Business field will be hidden from the user interface while retaining Food & Beverage as the backend value, ensuring consistency with existing business rules and downstream logic. 
 *  Opportunities, process flows, and related data tied to H5 accounts will follow Food & Beverage business rules only, simplifying the user experience and alignment. 
 

 
This feature covers remediation of Global Business usage, tab visibility changes, harmonization of related tabs, and a specific focus on how Scope of Work (SOW) records will be handled when Water and Hygiene corporate accounts are merged. 

 
Key Scope Items 

 *  1. Global Business Field Remediation 

 *  Hide the Global Business field from H5/Org account forms. 
 *  Retain Food & Beverage as the backend value for merged Hygiene H5 accounts. 
 *  Conduct a technical spike to document where Global Business is referenced across CRM (opportunity forms, quick create forms, BPFs, action forms) and dependent apps (e.g., Enterprise Scope Builder). 
 *  Define a remediation plan to ensure functionality is preserved without relying on the Global Business field. 
 

 *  Opportunities & Sales Skill Considerations 

 *  All new opportunities linked to H5 accounts will follow Food & Beverage logic. 
 *  Water-specific opportunity logic (e.g., drop-down values, BPF rules) will no longer apply. 
 *  Confirm with business whether Sales Skill should be introduced on the opportunity to help differentiate Water vs. Hygiene opportunities in a unified H5 model. 
 *  Defer opportunity harmonization unless explicitly approved by business. 
 

 *  Scope of Work (SOW) Handling 

 *  Background: Today, Water and Hygiene can each have separate H5 accounts, each with its own SOW. In the new model, both will share the same H5 (the Hygiene H5 will survive, Water H5 will be merged). 
 *  Problem: After merging, this can result in two SOWs tied to one H5, which is not permitted. CRM allows only one active SOW per corporate account. 
 *  Decision Needed: Business must define rules for consolidation. Options include: 

 *  Deactivate the Water SOW and merge its line items into the surviving Hygiene SOW. 
 *  Provide business-driven rules for how line items should be combined (e.g., which fields override, how duplicates are handled). 
 

 *  Expectation: The result must be a single active SOW tied to the merged H5 account, containing both Water and Hygiene details as appropriate. 
 *  Next Step: Provide the business with data extracts to inform their decision and then configure the merge logic accordingly. 
 

 *  Tab Visibility & Configuration 

 *  Cases tab ? Hidden on H5 accounts. 
 *  Enterprise Onboarding tab ? Hidden on H5 accounts. 
 *  TSR tab ? Remains visible and functional. 
 *  Team Member tab ? Harmonize to remove irrelevant roles (e.g., District Manager, Sales Manager) and align with business-approved roles. 
 *  Other Tabs (e.g., Key Business Drivers, Email Domains, Secondary Org Accounts) ? Review visibility with business and configure accordingly. 
 

 *  Enterprise Scope Builder & Related Apps 

 *  Validate if the Enterprise Scope Builder (PowerApp) or other related apps rely on the Global Business field. 
 *  If yes, remediation must ensure filtering/logic works in the new H5 model (either always using Food & Beverage backend value or shifting to Sales Skill as the filter). 
 

 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Technical Spike Outcomes: Documented inventory of Global Business usage across CRM + Enterprise Scope Builder with remediation plan. 
 *  Form & Field Updates: Global Business field hidden from H5 UI; backend value retained as Food & Beverage. 
 *  Scope of Work: Agreed business rules for merging Water/Hygiene SOWs, with configuration ensuring only one active SOW per H5. 
 *  Tab Configuration: Cases and Enterprise Onboarding hidden; TSR remains visible; Team Member/Scope of Work harmonized. 
 *  Business Rule Documentation: Clear articulation of how opportunities, SOW, and Sales Skill will behave in the unified model. 
 *  Implementation Readiness: R1 vs. R2 scope documented with business-approved decisions.

861007,Decision,,,,,,Handling Enterprise Opportunities on Corporate H5 Accounts (R1 Scope),,,"Context: 
Two user stories were created to address new requirements on Enterprise Opportunities for Corporate H5 accounts:

 *  857159: Require Sales Skill Selection When Creating Opportunities on H5 Accounts (1C Only) - https://ecolaboip.visualstudio.com/Dynamics%20365%20Convergence/_workitems/edit/857159 
 *  857160: Display and Enforce Technology Platform Field on H5 Opportunities (1C Only and Water Sales Skill Only) - https://ecolaboip.visualstudio.com/Dynamics%20365%20Convergence/_workitems/edit/857160 
 

 
During review with Arpit and Shamil, it was determined these enhancements are not required for R1 and should instead be treated as future enhancements (R2 or beyond). 
 

 
Decision (R1): 

 *  For R1, when a user creates an Enterprise Opportunity on a Corporate H5 account: 

 *  The Food & Beverage Opportunity form (Hygiene H5 template) will always load. 
 *  The Nalco Water Opportunity form will not appear (since the surviving H5 is always a Hygiene H5). 
 *  Sales Skill field will not be introduced on the Opportunity form. 
 *  Technology Platform field will not be introduced on the Opportunity form. 
 

 *  Users can utilize the Opportunity Description field to manually indicate: 

 *  Whether the opportunity is for Water or Hygiene. 
 *  Any Technology Platform details that are relevant. 
 

 

Workaround for R1: 

 *  Sales Skill segregation ? captured in the Opportunity Description field. 
 *  Technology Platform ? captured in the Opportunity Description field. 
 

 
Future Consideration (R2 or beyond): 

 *  A dedicated Sales Skill field on Opportunities. 
 *  Enforceable Technology Platform field on Water opportunities. 
 *  These may be revisited as part of broader Opportunity harmonization. 
 

 
Implications if Business Rejects This Decision: 
If Bri and Tracy do not approve this decision, the two user stories will remain in scope for R1: 
 

 *  857159: Require Sales Skill Selection When Creating Opportunities on H5 Accounts (1C Only) - https://ecolaboip.visualstudio.com/Dynamics%20365%20Convergence/_workitems/edit/857159

863484,User Story,,,,,,"DC: Re-Parent Water H5 Opportunities to Surviving Hygiene H5 with Sales Skill, Technology Platform, and PAC Code Updates in Description",,,"As a data conversion analyst, I need to re-parent all Water H5 opportunities (active and closed) to the surviving Hygiene H5 account during 1C consolidation, while preserving critical context by appending key Water-specific fields (Sales Skill, Technology Platform, and PAC Code) into the description field, so that business users retain visibility of these attributes in R1 despite the absence of harmonized opportunity forms.
 
 
Background & Rationale:

 *  Current State: 

 *  Opportunities in Water require Technology Platform. 
 *  Opportunities in Hygiene require Innovation Growth. 
 *  These values are not harmonized across global business units. 
 *  Opportunity forms differ for Water vs. Hygiene. 
 

 *  Future State (R2+): 

 *  Business wants to introduce a Sales Skill field on Opportunities for harmonization. 
 *  This will unify Water and Hygiene opportunities under a single Food & Beverage H5 account. 
 

 *  R1 Workaround: 

 *  Since harmonization cannot be delivered in R1, the manual workaround is to surface this data in the Opportunity Description field. 
 *  For migrated Water opportunities, the description will include: 

 *  Sales Skill: Water 
 *  Technology Platform: <Platform Value> 
 *  PAC Code: <PAC Code Value> 
 

 

 *  This ensures users retain visibility of critical Water fields when opportunities are moved under Hygiene H5. 
 

 *  Scope: 

 *  Applies to 1C Water H5 opportunities only. 
 *  Non-1C Water H5 opportunities remain unchanged. 
 *  For mixed H5s (where not all child accounts are part of 1C), business must handle migration manually (or decide on automation if volumes are high). 
 

 

Business Requirements:
 

 *  Re-parenting Logic: Re-parent all opportunities from Water H5 ? Hygiene H5 as part of 1C migration (active and closed). 
 *  Description Updates: Append Sales Skill, Technology Platform, and PAC Code into the Opportunity Description while preserving existing description content. 
 *  Formatting: Values must be clearly labeled with prefixes (Sales Skill:, Technology Platform:, PAC Code:) and separated by line breaks. 
 *  Scope Restriction: Applies only to 1C Water H5s. Non-1C remain unchanged. 
 *  Exception Handling: For mixed Water H5s (child accounts not fully part of 1C), log exception for manual resolution. 
 *  Data Validation: Post-conversion, validate that all re-parented opportunities on Hygiene H5 accounts show correct description updates and maintain all original fields (dates, owner, stage, etc.).

 *  Scenario 1 – Active Water H5 Opportunity in 1C 

 *  Given a Water H5 account is merged to a Hygiene H5 under 1C, and the Water H5 has an active opportunity 
 *  When the data conversion runs 
 *  Then the opportunity is re-parented to the Hygiene H5, and the description field is updated to append: 

 *  Sales Skill: Water

 *  Scenario 2 – Closed/Inactive Water H5 Opportunity 

 *  Given a Water H5 account under 1C with closed or inactive opportunities 
 *  When the data conversion runs 
 *  Then those opportunities are re-parented to the Hygiene H5, and the description field is updated with the same Sales Skill, Technology Platform, and PAC Code details. 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Non-1C Water H5  

 *  Given a Water H5 account not part of 1C migration  
 *  When the data conversion runs  
 *  Then the Water H5 opportunities remain unchanged and no description updates are applied.  
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Mixed Accounts (Exception Case) 

 *  Given a Water H5 account has child accounts not fully part of 1C migration 
 *  When the data conversion runs 
 *  Then the process must flag the opportunities as exceptions, log them in an exception report, and business must handle migration manually (or determine automation if volume is high).

857162,Requirement,,,,,Enable Scope of Work (SOW) Segregation by Sales Skill on H5 Accounts for One Customer,,,,"Business requires the ability to manage parallel Scope of Work (SOW) records for Water and Hygiene under a single H5 account in One Customer (1C) districts. Today, CRM restricts H5 accounts to one active SOW at a time; new submissions deactivate existing SOWs. With the new model, both Water and Hygiene can co-exist under the same H5 account while maintaining correct segregation, filtering, and downstream visibility.
 

 
This requirement includes:
 

 *  Sales Skill Integration: 

 *  Add Sales Skill lookup field on the SOW header record (mandatory for 1C org accounts, hidden for non-1C). 
 *  Lock Sales Skill once submitted. 
 *  Global Business field continues to exist behind the scenes (derived from Sales Skill, hidden from users). 
 

 *  Offerings & Features Filtering: 

 *  Add multi-select Global Business Option set on Offering table. 
 *  Filter feature selection in Enterprise Scope Builder so that only features with offerings tied to the selected Sales Skill display (Global Business). 
 *  Filter offering selection so that only offerings tied to both the selected feature and Sales Skill display (Global Business). 
 

 *  Enterprise Scope Builder (Power App) Flow: 

 *  General Information Screen: Add Sales Skill lookup, mandatory for 1C orgs. 
 *  Feature Selection Screen: Show only features relevant to selected Sales Skill. 
 *  Offering Screen: Show only offerings linked to both Sales Skill + feature(s). 
 *  Lock Sales Skill once submitted. 
 

 *  SOW Grid (H5 Tab): 

 *  Add Sales Skill column to the editable grid displayed on the Scope of Work tab of H5 accounts. 
 *  Allow users to clearly identify which Sales Skill each SOW belongs to alongside existing fields (name, start date, end date, status, owner). 
 

 *  Validation & Logic: 

 *  Update uniqueness validation: allow parallel SOWs for the same H5, but only one per Sales Skill at a time. 
 *  Update trickle-down plugin/Azure function so that only relevant SOWs appear on the matching Sales Skill accounts. 
 

 *  Data Conversion: 

 *  Reparent existing Water SOWs to surviving Hygiene H5s. 
 *  Populate Sales Skill lookup on migrated SOWs. 
 *  Audit overlapping SOWs and reconcile counts before/after migration. 
 

 *  Safeguards: 

 *  All changes apply only to 1C org accounts (H5 linked to a 1C district). 
 *  Non-1C org accounts remain unaffected, continuing with current one-SOW-per-H5 logic. 
 

 

 
This ensures sales teams can manage dual SOWs on the same H5, see clear Sales Skill context, and have correct downstream visibility in child Sales Skill accounts.

861015,User Story,,,,,,Update Uniqueness Validation Logic on SOW – Allow Parallel Active SOWs by Sales Skill (1C Only),,," 
As a sales user creating a Scope of Work (SOW) on an H5 account,
I need the uniqueness validation logic updated to allow parallel active SOWs by Sales Skill
 
so that I can create and maintain separate Water and Hygiene SOWs for the same H5 without deactivating or blocking one another.
 

 
Background / Current State:
 

 *  Currently, CRM + ESB PowerApp enforce a restriction where only one active SOW can exist per H5 at a time. 
 *  When a new SOW is submitted with overlapping dates, the Submit button is disabled on the Review screen, preventing submission. 
 *  If submitted, the system automatically deactivates the overlapping existing SOW, regardless of Sales Skill. 
 *  This prevents the business from managing parallel Water and Hygiene SOWs under the same H5. 
 

 
Future State 1C: 

 *  Validation logic must respect Sales Skill context: 
 *  If a new SOW is created with the same Sales Skill and overlapping dates ? existing logic applies (only one can be active). 
 *  If a new SOW is created with a different Sales Skill and overlapping dates ? submission should be allowed and both remain active in parallel. 
 

 
This applies both to the Review screen Submit button validation and any backend deactivation logic. 

 
For non-1C districts, existing behavior of the app remains unchanged.

 *  Scenario 1 – 1C: Same Sales Skill, Overlapping Period 

 *  Given an H5 account already has an active SOW with Sales Skill = Water 
 *  When I attempt to submit Activate a new SOW with Sales Skill = Water with overlapping dates 
 *  Then the Submit Activate SoW button is disabled and I cannot proceed until the date range does not overlap. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – 1C: Same Sales Skill, Non-Overlapping Period 

 *  Given an H5 account already has an active SOW with Sales Skill = Water 
 *  When I submit Activate a new SOW with Sales Skill = Water with non-overlapping dates 
 *  Then the Submit Activate SoW button is enabled and both SOWs can be linked to the Account. 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – 1C: Different Sales Skill, Overlapping Period 

 *  Given an H5 account already has an active SOW with Sales Skill = Water 
 *  When I submit Activate a new SOW with Sales Skill = Hygiene with overlapping dates 
 *  Then the Submit Activate SoW button is enabled, and both SOWs (Water + Hygiene) remain active in parallel. 
 

 *  Scenario 4 – 1C: Different Sales Skill, Non-Overlapping Period 

 *  Given an H5 account already has an active SOW with Sales Skill = Water 
 *  When I submit Activate SoW a new SOW with Sales Skill = Hygiene with non-overlapping dates 
 *  Then the Submit Activate SoW button is enabled, and both SOWs remain active in parallel. 
 

 *  Scenario 5 – 1C: Null / Missing Sales Skill Values 

 *  Given a SOW record has a null or missing Sales Skill 
 *  When a user attempts to submit Activate another SOW 
 *  Then the system enforces validation as though both are the same Sales Skill (block overlaps until cleaned up). 
 

 *  Scenario 6 – Non-1C (All Cases) 

 *  Given an H5 account not linked to a 1C district 
 *  When a user attempts to create Activate a new SOW (overlapping or non-overlapping) 
 *  Then the current behavior applies: only one active SOW per H5 is permitted.

861016,User Story,,,,,,Update Trickle-Down Logic: Ensure Only Matching Sales Skill Accounts Receive the Relevant SOW.,,,"As a Sales user working on Sales Skill accounts,
I need the trickle-down logic for Scope of Work (SOW) records updated,
 
So that only SOWs with a matching Sales Skill appear on the relevant Sales Skill account tab,
 
Ensuring Water users only see Water SOWs and Hygiene users only see Hygiene SOWs.
 

 
Current State:
 

 *  When an SOW is submitted and activated, a process (plugin/Azure Function) automatically establishes a record in the out-of-the-box N:N relationship table (ECL_ECL_scopeofwork_account). 
 *  This N:N relationship links the SOW record to all child Sales Skill accounts under the H5 account. 
 *  Because there is no filtering, both Water and Hygiene SOWs appear on all linked Sales Skill accounts, causing confusion. 
 

 
Future State: 

 *  The relationship logic must check that the Sales Skill of the SOW matches the Sales Skill of the Sales Skill account before creating the relationship. 
 *  Example: 

 *  If the H5 has both Water and Hygiene SOWs, and I open the Water Sales Skill account, I should only see Water SOWs. 
 *  If I open the Hygiene Sales Skill account, I should only see Hygiene SOWs. 
 

 *  Non-1C accounts remain unaffected (existing logic continues without change).

 *  Given multiple active SOWs exist for the same Organization Account (H5) (e.g., one for Water and one for Hygiene), 
 *  When I view the Scope of Work tab on the child Sales Skill Account form, 
 *  Then only the SOW(s) matching that Sales Skill must be displayed.

 *  Given I open a Customer account linked to an Organization Account (H5) in a non-1C district, 
 *  When I view the Scope of Work tab on the child Account form, 
 *  Then the current behavior remains unchanged (all linked SOWs display without filtering).

2.CRM Asset Type Template records areauto-generated 

Requirement 

Conduct comprehensive regression testing of the Scope of Work (SOW) functionality in CRM to ensure that all existing features continue to perform as expected following updates, enhancements, or integrations. 

Business Objective 

To validate the stability and reliability of the SOW functionality across Water and Hygiene business units by: 

 *  Ensuring no disruption to service plan creation and execution. 
 *  Confirming compatibility with integrated systems (e.g., Ecolab 3D, Asset Harvester). 
 *  Supporting consistent user experience for CAMs, DMs, Reps, and Field Services. 
 *  Maintaining data integrity and compliance during migrations and updates. 
 

Requirements In Scope 

 *  Regression testing of:

 *  SOW creation via Enterprise Scope Builder. 
 *  Service plan generation from SOW records. 
 *  PDF export functionality. 
 *  Asset-level and site-level template usage. 
 *  Role-based access and record visibility. 
 *  Integration with Ecolab 3D and Asset Harvester. 
 

 
 *  Validation of:

 *  One active SOW per account per time period. 
 *  Migration logic for legacy SOW documents. 
 *  Automated org account creation during onboarding. 
 

 
 

Technical Considerations & Configuration 

 *  CRM stores SOW and service plan records. 
 *  Dataverse used for team member and contact data. 
 *  PDF export tested for formatting and completeness. 
 *  Asset Harvester integration verified for Water and Hygiene. 
 *  Data conversion rules tested for accuracy and completeness. 
 *  End-to-end regression test scenarios include:

 *  SOW creation, activation, and service plan linkage. 
 *  Role-based access and permissions. 
 *  Template selection and customization. 
 

 
 

User Interface Configuration 

 *  CAMs initiate and manage SOW records from CRM account view. 
 *  Reps and DMs access service plans derived from SOWs. 
 *  OPS Admins manage hygiene templates and asset data. 
 *  UI elements tested for consistency, responsiveness, and usability. 
 

Security & Data Governance 

 *  Role-based access tested for CAMs, Reps, DMs, OPS Admins, and Field Services. 
 *  Validation workflows ensure data integrity before activation. 
 *  Migration logic tested for completeness and accuracy. 
 *  Governance over template usage and asset data loading confirmed. 
 

Context
The Scope of Work (SOW) functionality in CRM enables Corporate Account Managers (CAMs) to define service expectations at the organizational account level. These expectations guide District Managers (DMs) and Sales Representatives (Reps) on what services to perform at customer sites. The SOW acts as a directional tool, outlining commitments such as frequency of visits, types of services, and reporting requirements. It supports both Water and Hygiene business units, with differences in asset-level versus site-level service definitions.
SOW Org accounts are a grouping which can span across districts. 
Downstream Systems / Integration 

 *  CRM: Central system for managing accounts, SOWs, and service plans. 
 *  Asset Harvester: Supplies asset data to CRM (currently missing for Hygiene). 
 *  Ecolab 3D: Receives service reports and sends them to selected recipients. 
 *  Dataverse: Shared tables used for team member and contact data. 
 *  PDF Export: Allows sharing of service plans with customers manually. 
 

Impact Considerations 

 *  Water Business: Services are tied to site values. No change required. 
 *  Field Services Team: Services are tied to ship-to values. R1 data conversion requirement. 
 *  Hygiene Business: Operates at site level only due to lack of asset data. No change required. 
 *  Standalone (Street) Accounts: No parent org account; SOW and service plans are created directly at the customer account level. 
 *  Documents (PDFs of SOWs) will need to be migrated as part of OneCustomer efforts. 
 

Groups
Water & Hygiene 
Personas 

 *  Corporate Account Managers (CAMs): Create and manage SOWs at the organization account level. Select features within the Enterprise Scope Builder Power App that are related to the SOW. 
 *  District Managers (DMs): Reference SOWs to build service plans and execute site-level services. 
 *  Sales Reps: Reference SOWs to build service plans and execute site-level services. Water reps set up the SOW & Service Plans. 
 *  OPS Admins: Particularly for Hygiene accounts, they manage SOW creation and service templates. 
 *  Field Services Team: Execute services based on recurring service records, separate from district team plans. 
 

Business Process Flow 

 *  Operations team creates the CRM Account record. 
 *  CAM initiates SOW creation via the Enterprise Scope Builder app on a CRM organization account record. 
 *  CAM enters SOW inputs:

 *  Name, start/end dates 
 *  Selected service commitments (e.g., business reviews, entry/exit meetings, weekly visits) 
 *  Comments for context 
 

 
 *  Service Plan Builder: Reps use this to create service plans based on SOW guidance. 
 *  Customization: Reps can adjust frequency or add services as needed. 
 *  CAM activates the SOW: Only one active SOW per time period is allowed.

 *  Validation and Activation: Final review and activation of service plans generate recurring service records. 
 *  CRM Asset Type Template records are auto-generated.

862784,User Story,,,,,,ESB PowerApp – Update Review SOW Screen to Display Locked Sales Skill Field,,,"As a Sales or CAM user creating a Scope of Work (SOW) in the ESB PowerApp,
I need to see the Sales Skill value displayed on the Review SOW screen in read-only mode,
 
So that I have visibility into which Sales Skill (Water or Hygiene) the SOW belongs to, and I can confirm the alignment with the features, and offerings selected, without being able to change it at this stage.
 

 
Background & Rationale:
 

 *  Sales Skill is first selected on the General Information screen. 
 *  It drives the filtering of Features and Offerings in subsequent steps. 
 *  On the Review SOW screen, users today see key information like SOW Name, Account, Start Date, End Date, and Status — but Sales Skill is missing. 
 *  Since Sales Skill determines all downstream filtering, it must be displayed for review, but must remain locked/uneditable, as changing it at this stage would invalidate previous selections. 
 *  This ensures clarity for users while preserving data integrity.

861916,User Story,,,,,,ESB PowerApp – Enhance Copy SOW Functionality with Sales Skill Support (Azure Function),,,"As a sales user working in the Enterprise Scope Builder (ESB) PowerApp,
 
I want the Copy SOW functionality to copy the Sales Skill field into the cloned draft record,
 
So that I have full visibility of the Sales Skill being cloned, and I can update it before submission.
 

 
Background & Rationale:
 

 *  Today, Copy SOW pop-up displays Account name, Start Date, End Date. 
 *  When copying, the system creates a new Draft SOW with “: Clone” appended to the name and copies over the dates. 
 *  With the introduction of Sales Skill for 1C districts, the Copy process must: 

 *  Display Sales Skill in the pop-up for awareness, (Requirement is now covered in user story 863482) 
 *  Clone the Sales Skill value into the new Draft SOW, 
 *  Lock edits to Sales Skill Field on the Cloned record. 
 

 *  For non-1C accounts, no Sales Skill field should be shown in the pop-up or cloned record. 
 *  For Street accounts (with dedicated Sales Skill), the Sales Skill should also display in the pop-up and copy correctly.(Requirement is now covered in user story 863482)

863482,User Story,,,,,,ESB PowerApp – End-to-End UI Enhancements with Sales Skill (1C vs Non-1C),,,"As a Sales User or CAM creating or managing a Scope of Work (SOW) in the Enterprise Scope Builder (ESB) PowerApp,
 
 
I need the application screens (General Information, Feature Selection, Commitments, Review, and Copy) to incorporate Sales Skill selection, filtering, and display logic only for 1C accounts,
 
so that SOWs can be correctly tied to Water/Hygiene Sales Skills, ensuring downstream accuracy.
 
For non-1C accounts, the behavior must remain exactly as today with no changes to forms or filtering.
 

 
Background & Rationale:
Today, the Enterprise Scope Builder (ESB) PowerApp does not distinguish Water vs Hygiene SOWs within the same H5 account. 

 
Currently, CRM allows only one active SOW per H5 at a time. Creating a new one deactivates the previous, regardless of business line.
 
With OneCustomer, a single H5 can now represent both Water and Hygiene, and business needs the ability to maintain parallel active SOWs—one for each Sales Skill.
 
To achieve this, ESB must capture the Sales Skill at the time of SOW creation, and filter features/offerings accordingly.
 
This field must also drive downstream filtering, validation, and visibility for users so they only see what is relevant.
 

 
[Image]
 

 
Key Principle: 

 *  For 1C districts/accounts, Sales Skill functionality must be introduced (visible, required, used for filtering, review, copy, and lock logic). 
 *  For non-1C accounts, no changes—system should behave exactly as today to avoid regression. 
 

 
This story covers all UI and functional changes in ESB PowerApp required to support Sales Skill for SOWs. 
It includes changes to:
 

 *  General Information Screen – Sales Skill selection, defaulting, required logic. 
 *  Feature Selection Screen – Filter features by offerings tied to selected Sales Skill. 
 *  Commitment Selection Screen – Filter offerings by feature + Sales Skill. 
 *  Review Screen – Display Sales Skill in read-only mode. 
 *  Copy SOW Pop-Up (UI) – Include Sales Skill in pop-up and cloned draft. 
 *  Lock Behavior – Once submitted and Active, lock Sales Skill field (End Date remains editable). 
 

 
This ensures Sales Skill flows consistently from creation ? filtering ? review ? copy ? active state, maintaining integrity across the SOW lifecycle. 


Business Requirements:
 

 *  General Information Screen 

 *  Add Sales Skill lookup (visible + required for 1C only). 
 *  Corporate H5 with CAM ? default = Hygiene, editable until user clicks on Next button. 
 *  Street H5 (no CAM) ? default = Sales Skill of launching Sales Skill account, locked. 
 *  Non-1C accounts ? Sales Skill hidden, behavior unchanged. 
 

 *  Feature Selection Screen 

 *  Derive Global Business from Sales Skill. 
 *  Display only Features tied to Offerings associated with that Global Business. 
 *  Hide Features with no offerings tied to the selected Sales Skill. 
 *  Non-1C accounts ? no change to filtering logic. 
 

 *  Commitment Selection Screen 

 *  For each Feature selected, show only Offerings tied to that Feature and derived Global Business. 
 *  Hide Offerings not linked to Sales Skill. 
 *  Non-1C accounts ? no change to commitment filtering. 
 

 *  Review SOW Screen 

 *  Add Sales Skill field in read-only mode. 
 *  Must carry forward from General Info screen. 
 *  Locked—cannot be edited at Review stage. 
 *  Non-1C ? field hidden, current fields only. 
 

 *  Copy SOW Pop-Up 

 *  Show Account Name, Start Date, End Date, and Sales Skill (for 1C). 
 *  Sales Skill is cloned into new draft record. 
 *  Non-1C ? pop-up unchanged, Sales Skill hidden. 
 

 *  Lock Sales Skill Behavior (Post-Activation) 

 *  Once SOW is submitted and Active ? lock Sales Skill field. 
 *  Only End Date editable. 
 *  Non-1C ? no changes.

 *  In-Scope 

 *  Customers flagged by business as in scope for 1C. 
 *  Water H5 and Hygiene H5 identification & linkage. 
 *  Active SOWs on Water H5s only (inactive/expired are out of scope for re-parenting). 
 *  Detection of mixed H5s: Water H5 whose child accounts include both 1C and non-1C accounts. 
 *  Decision framework: when to re-parent, when to clone/create new SOW(s), when to leave as-is. 
 *  Delivery of scripts/queries to reproduce counts and exception files. 
 *  Mapping: Water H5 ? Hygiene H5 (surviving). 
 *  SOW extract (id, H5 id, status, dates, owner , Primary Owner ).

 *  For each Water H5 with active SOW, does every child account belong to the 1C list? 

 *  If yes ? candidate for automated re-parent to Hygiene H5. 
 *  If no (mixed) ? cannot blindly re-parent; propose manual or scripted SOW creation on Hygiene H5, leaving Water SOW in place for non-1C child accounts. 
 

 *  What is the volume of mixed H5s, and how many SOWs are impacted? 
 *  What is the recommended approach per case (manual vs automation) based on volume/complexity? 
 *  What are the controls (recon reports) to prove completeness/correctness?

I need to ensure that all Scope of Work (SOW) records impacted by the One Customer migration have their Sales Skill lookup field correctly populated,
 
So that users can clearly distinguish between Water and Hygiene SOWs on the surviving H5 account and downstream processes (e.g., trickle-down, filtering, reporting) function correctly.
 

 
Background & Rationale:
 

 *  In the current state, SOWs do not have an explicit Sales Skill field; all commitments are tied directly to H5 accounts. 
 *  In the future state, H5 accounts will support parallel SOWs for Water and Hygiene. 
 *  To differentiate and filter correctly, each SOW record must be tagged with the appropriate Sales Skill. 
 *  During migration, any SOWs being re-parented or merged into a surviving Hygiene H5 account must have the correct Sales Skill populated. 
 *  Business will provide mapping logic/rules to assign the correct Sales Skill (e.g., Water ? Nalco Water Sales Skill, Hygiene ? F&B Sales Skill).

This story only covers adding the field, exposing it on the Offering form, and ensuring it is visible in the Offering entity views.
 
Any logic for filtering Offerings during Scope of Work creation will be handled in a separate user story.

 *  Scenario 2 – Offering Form Update 

 *  Given I open the Offering record form, 
 *  When the form loads, 
 *  Then I must see the Global Business field displayed and editable. (Add it below the Unit Type) 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Offering View Update (Add it after the Feature Column) 

 *  Given I open the Offering grid view,(All the OOB views of this table) 
 *  When the view loads, 
 *  Then the Global Business column must be visible alongside existing Offering columns.(Add it after the Feature Column) 
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Backward Compatibility 

 *  Given existing Offerings already exist in CRM,

861882,Release Details,,,,,,,Update Global Business Values on Active Offerings Using Provided Mapping,,"As a CRM system administrator,
 
I need to update the Global Business multi-select option set field for all active Offering records,
 
So that each Offering is correctly tagged to its respective global business (e.g., Nalco Water, Food & Beverage, Life Sciences, Textile Care),
 
And downstream processes such as Scope of Work filtering and Feature/Offering visibility work correctly for One Customer (FBU) accounts.
 

 
Business stakeholders will provide a definitive mapping list (currently ~67 active offerings) that associates each Offering with one or more Global Business values.
 
The CRM team must update the Offering records accordingly, ensuring all active Offerings are aligned before FBU scope of work filtering logic is enabled.

834300,Feature,,,,CRM: Base Customer Account Experience & Site Visibility Management,,,,," 
This feature introduces the Base Customer Account (BCA) in CRM — a new, unified customer record that represents the corporate or enterprise customer across all sales skills (Water and F&B). The BCA will act as the central hub for viewing and managing all downstream customer interactions, including associated accounts, sites, opportunities, assets, and service history. This change supports the One Customer model by improving transparency, reducing duplicate data, and enabling enterprise-level visibility.

 
From a business perspective, the BCA enables a 360° view of the customer across sales skills and regions. Users will now be able to easily understand which sites, accounts, and business relationships are part of a single enterprise, without navigating through fragmented records. The CRM user interface will be updated with new views, lookups, and dashboards that clearly present this relationship and make it easy to navigate.
 

 
From a technical implementation standpoint, the following changes are included: 

 *  A new BCA table/entity will be created in CRM, designed for read-only access for most users. 
 *  The BCA form will include aggregated views (e.g., lists of linked accounts, sites, opportunities) using controls such as PCF/ECF to summarize key related data. 
 *  Sales skill account forms will be updated to include a lookup field to BCA, which will only be visible when applicable (e.g., based on One Customer flag). 
 *  All CRM views will be reviewed and updated to ensure they reflect the BCA-to-account relationship accurately. New views will be introduced to support enterprise account search and reporting. 
 *  The BCA will include key metadata fields such as District, Sales Org, Market Segment, Sub-Segment, Global Business, and Sales Skill, enabling consistent customer segmentation and alignment across CRM and downstream systems. 
 *  Legacy logic that prevents duplicate ERP numbers across accounts will be reviewed and revised, enabling Water and F&B to coexist under the same ERP ID when applicable. 
 *  CRM plugins and validations will be updated to reflect the new logic for account creation, duplicate checks, and global business assignment. 
 *  Master data updates are a critical dependency: District, Sales Org, Segment, Market Segment, and Sub-Segment values will need to be aligned with the new One Customer structure. This will be managed through initial configuration and weekly load processes, and must be completed before BCA creation is functional. 
 *  This feature is tightly integrated with the customer setup process: during prospect-to-customer conversion, Sales Skill selection will drive downstream MDM and EBS behavior, including the creation of the BCA and its link to the originating account. 
 

 
This feature is foundational for One Customer enablement and will directly impact CRM forms, business rules, data quality, integrations, and master data alignment. It ensures users gain simplified navigation and complete visibility while enabling backend systems to operate on a harmonized enterprise structure.

854661,Decision,,,,,Design Decision: Use Native N:N Relationships for Sales Skill Mapping (District–Sales Skill & Market Segment–Sales Skill),,,,"Decision Statement:
We have decided to implement Sales Skill mappings (both District–Sales Skill and Market Segment–Sales Skill) using the native N:N relationship in CRM, rather than creating custom intersect tables.
 

 
Rationale:
 

 *  Latest CRM release supports advanced lookup filtering on standard N:N relationships, addressing the previous limitation. 
 *  No requirement exists for custom attributes on either relationship, making a custom intersect table unnecessary. 
 *  Native N:N provides simpler architecture, reduced maintenance, and better alignment with OOTB capabilities. 
 

 
Implications: 

 *  Data Dictionary must be updated to reflect native N:N relationships only for both District–Sales Skill and Market Segment–Sales Skill. 
 *  All references to custom intersect tables must be removed. 
 *  Any dependent user stories or technical spikes will leverage native relationships for filtering, reporting, and data model design. 
 

 
Action Items: 

 *  Ashish to rework the Data Dictionary and update the Technical Spike accordingly. 
 *  Updated Data Dictionary to be submitted to Siddharth for review. 
 *  Link this decision to related user stories (e.g., District–Sales Skill Mapping View, Market Segment–Sales Skill Mapping View).

835304,Requirement,,,,,9. Role-Based Access and Navigation Model for Base Customer Account (BCA) in CRM,,,,"Business Capability:
 
Today, CRM users in Food & Beverage United (FBU) operate primarily in silos based on their assigned sales skill (Water or Hygiene). Each sales rep, district manager (DM), or corporate account manager (CAM) works within the bounds of their business line and accesses only those accounts that fall under their ownership or territory. There is no unified view of the customer across sales skills, and access is highly fragmented. 

 
With the One Customer initiative, the organization is moving toward a consolidated customer model. Under this new model, multiple Sales Skill Accounts (Water or Hygiene) will be linked under a central entity called the Base Customer Account (BCA). This allows for:
 

 *  A 360° view of customer engagement across business lines. 
 *  Consolidated opportunity visibility. 
 *  Unified account management strategies. 
 

 
The business wants to maintain tight control over who sees what to avoid information overload while still promoting cross-collaboration and transparency where needed. Key business personas will require different types of access: 

 *  Sales Reps (Water or Hygiene) should continue to see only their aligned accounts in “My Accounts” but should be able to navigate to the linked BCA to view a consolidated picture and understand what’s happening in other business lines (e.g., a Water rep viewing Hygiene opportunities). 
 *  District Managers (DMs) will oversee both Water and Hygiene accounts under their district. They should be able to navigate directly to BCAs from the sitemap and view all associated Sales Skill Accounts under their purview. 
 *  Corporate Account Managers (CAMs) will manage parent H5/organization-level accounts and should have a way to discover and access all BCAs linked to their parent accounts, enabling them to manage strategic relationships more effectively. 
 

 
In the future state, ownership will remain unchanged for Sales Skill Accounts, but access to BCAs should be read-only and granted via controlled security mechanisms (roles or team-based access). The goal is to enable insight without disrupting current ownership and access boundaries. 

 
Corporate (H5) Account Ownership and Visibility

 *  H5 (Corporate) accounts are identified using the “Parent Account” field on the Base Customer Account (BCA) and/or Sales Skill Account forms. 
 *  This “Parent Account” is a lookup field—users can click to navigate to the Corporate Account record. 
 *  Only Corporate Account Managers (CAMs) should have full ownership and write access to H5 accounts. 
 *  All H5 accounts should be owned by CAMs by default and shared explicitly with backup CAMs or appropriate regional corporate roles. 
 *  Non-CAM users (e.g., AMs, DMs, BDMs, ) should: 

 *  Have read-only access to the H5 account only if it’s linked to their Sales Skill Account via BCA. 
 *  Be able to see the Parent Account field, click and navigate to the Corporate Account (read-only). 
 *  Not be allowed to edit or replace the H5 account lookup on the sales skill account form. 
 

 *  User Experience Consideration: 

 *  When a user clicks the Parent Account link (H5), the system should open the H5 account record in read-only mode, unless the user is a CAM. 
 *  Attempting to edit an H5 record by a non-CAM user should result in a “read-only access” banner or toast message, clarifying access restrictions. 
 

 

 
 

 
Technical Implementation Considerations: 

 *  Security Role & Access Design: 

 *  Implement a dedicated security role (e.g., “BCA Read Access”) to provide read-only access to the Base Customer Account entity. 
 *  Evaluate whether record-level sharing (manual or automated) or team ownership of BCA records is most scalable. 
 *  Team ownership preferred for ease of maintenance and performance. 
 *  Evaluate the possibility of creating functional teams (e.g., FBU Sales Team, CAM Team) with access granted via business unit or persona membership. 
 

 *  Ownership of Base Customer Account: 

 *  BCAs should not be owned by individual users. 
 *  Assign BCAs to system or functional teams (e.g., “CRM BCA Admin”) to avoid accidental edits and simplify access management. 
 *  Ensure no duplicate ownership-related logic interferes with record-level permissions. 
 

 *  Sitemap Configuration: 

 *  Add a new section in the sitemap labeled “Base Customer Accounts” under Sales or Customer area. 
 *  Use a custom entity icon to differentiate BCA from standard account entities. 
 *  Views under BCA should include key fields: BCA Name, BCA Number, Primary Sales Skill Account, Total Opportunities, Industry, Sub-Market, Linked ERP ID. 
 *  Enable filters in views for Sales Skill, Territory, Ownership, and Account Status. 
 

 *  Form & Subgrid Design: 

 *  BCA form will include tabs for: 
 *  Linked Sales Skill Accounts (subgrid with hyperlinks). 
 *  Opportunities (aggregated view). 
 *  Contacts (aggregated or related). 
 *  Any reference metadata required (e.g., creation source, district, global business, sales skill summaries). 
 

 *  Persona-Based Navigation: 

 *  Sales Reps: 

 *  Maintain current access to only their assigned accounts. 
 *  Add a read-only BCA lookup on their accounts to allow click-through navigation. 
 *  No change to My Accounts views; BCA visibility only through linked records. 
 

 *  District Managers: 

 *  Access all BCAs under their territory directly from the sitemap. 
 *  Can use BCA views to manage full customer coverage across business lines. 
 

 *  Corporate Account Managers: 

 *  On organization (H5) accounts, update the Account-Contact-Email Domain tab: 
 *  Show linked Sales Skill Accounts with a new column for BCA Number (with hyperlink). 
 *  Allow CAMs to click into BCA to view overall footprint, accounts, and opportunities. 
 

 

 *  Technical Spikes and Risk Mitigation: 

 *  Conduct a technical spike to assess: 

 *  Team-based access vs. record sharing at scale. 
 *  Ability to propagate access via the Sales Skill Account ? BCA lookup. 
 *  UI performance or security cache limitations with large team memberships. 
 

 *  Evaluate if the sharing logic should be automated during Sales Skill Account creation or BCA linkage. 
 

 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Finalized BCA security role configuration and access provisioning model. 
 *  Updated CRM sitemap with Base Customer Account section and custom icon. 
 *  Configured views and forms with all required metadata and filters. 
 *  Functional subgrids and lookups: 

 *  On Sales Skill Account ? BCA (read-only, clickable). 
 *  On H5 parent ? Sales Skill Accounts + BCA link. 
 

 *  Documentation of technical spike outcomes: 

 *  Access model decision (team vs. sharing). 
 *  Record ownership structure. 
 *  Navigation strategy for each persona. 
 

 *  End-to-end regression testing for each persona (Sales Rep, DM, CAM) validating access, navigation, and security scope.

 *  Provide role-based access control for BCAs to ensure no manual edits by users. 
 *  Create two new security roles: 

 *  Team-Level Role (e.g., “Ecolab-1C-TASR”): Grants BCA read access scoped to district team ownership. 
 *  User-Level Role (e.g., “Ecolab-1C-UASR”): Grants BCA read access scoped to BU (FBNA). 
 

 *  Limit write access exclusively to integration accounts (CDM, E3D, etc.). 
 *  BCA records must remain read-only for all business personas, regardless of user role. 
 *  Ensure BCA navigation and global search results respect assigned roles. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Security Role Setup 

 *  Create two custom security roles: 

 *  Ecolab-1C-TASR (Team Access Security Role): Read, Append, Append To on BCA, scoped to district team ownership. 
 *  Ecolab-1C-UASR (User Access Security Role): Read, Append, Append To on BCA, scoped to BU/FBNA. 
 

 *  Assign privileges to Read, Append, Append To only. No Create/Write/Delete for business users. 
 *  Ensure service accounts (integration) retain full CRUD privileges. 
 

 *  Access Filtering 

 *  Configure ownership logic so BCA records are owned by the district team of the lead division account. 
 *  Ensure team-level security roles only display BCAs linked to the user’s team. 
 *  BU-level users (Accelerators, Ops Admins, BDMs) see all FBNA BCAs. 
 

 *  Navigation & Search Control 

 *  Update sitemap so BCA entity appears only when role is assigned. 
 *  Configure global search to respect role assignments.

As a CRM system administrator, I need to ensure that the Sales Skill master data table is secured with the correct access model, so that only authorized roles can create, update, or delete Sales Skill records while other roles have read-only access, ensuring both data integrity and proper visibility.

 *  The Sales Skill table will be created as an organization-owned entity. 
 *  Sales Skill lookups will be referenced in other tables (e.g., Account, User, District) and therefore require consistent read access for business users while restricting modification to admins only.

 *  Given I am a System Admin, 

 *  When I access the Sales Skill entity, 
 *  Then I can create, update, delete, read, append, and append to records without restriction. 
 

 *  Given I am an Ops Admin or Ops Admin Lead, 

 *  When I access the Sales Skill entity, 
 *  Then I can read records, append Sales Skill to related records, and append related records to Sales Skill, but cannot create, update, or delete Sales Skill records. 
 

 *  Given I am a business user (e.g., AM, DM, CAM, BDM, Sales Rep), 

 *  When I access forms or views that reference Sales Skill lookup fields (e.g., on Accounts, Users), 
 *  Then I can see and use the lookup values but cannot modify or create Sales Skill master data records. 
 

 *  Given Sales Skill is used as a lookup on Account, User, District, and other related entities, 

 *  When I attempt to view or assign values, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill values display consistently based on my security role permissions. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Sales Skill table must be organization-owned, ensuring consistent global security. 
 *  Maintain data integrity: only System Admins can directly manipulate the Sales Skill master data. 
 *  Ensure Ops Admins and Leads can leverage existing Sales Skill records for their operational duties (Append/Append To), but cannot alter master data. 
 *  Ensure all business users can see Sales Skill values wherever referenced (lookup, view, or report), but remain read-only. 
 *  Security must extend consistently to all references (Account, User, District, Customer Setup, etc.). 
 *  Prevent accidental or unauthorized creation of new Sales Skill values by non-admins. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Entity Ownership: SalesSkill will be configured as an Organization-Owned entity. 
 *  Role Permissions: 

 *  System Admin: Create = Yes, Read = Yes, Write = Yes, Delete = Yes, Append = Yes, Append To = Yes. 
 *  Ops Admin / Lead: Create = No, Read = Yes, Write = No, Delete = No, Append = Yes, Append To = Yes. 
 *  All Other Roles (AM, DM, CAM, BDM, Sales Reps, Service Users): Create = No, Read = Yes, Write = No, Delete = No, Append = Yes, Append To = Yes. 
 

 *  Lookup Behavior: 

 *  Lookup field on Account form (Sales Skill) ? visible, editable based on other field rules, but lookup values restricted to existing Sales Skill master data. 
 *  Lookup field on User form (Default Sales Skill) ? editable only where district is 1C and field unlocked per user story; security still enforces read-only on master data. 
 *  Lookup field on District form (N:N Sales Skill-District mapping) ? Ops Admin/System Admin can manage mapping; business users only consume. 
 

 *  Audit: All create/update/delete actions on Sales Skill records must be audited (user ID, timestamp, field changes). 
 *  Data Repair/Migration: At cutover, existing Sales Skill values (Water, Hygiene, etc.) must be bulk-loaded by System Admins; no business user action required. 
 *  Navigation: Sales Skill table should not be shown as a sitemap link for business users; only visible in admin apps. 
 *  Testing: 

 *  Verify System Admin full access. 
 *  Verify Ops Admin/Lead read + append only. 
 *  Verify business users can only consume values in lookups but cannot add/modify Sales Skill master data.

835303,Requirement,,,,,8. Enable Creation and Visibility of Sales Skill Accounts in CRM under a Unified Base Customer Account,,,,"Business Objective:
 
To enable cross-divisional growth and improve enterprise customer visibility, CRM must support the creation and lifecycle management of Sales Skill Accounts (e.g., Water, Hygiene) under a centralized Base Customer Account (BCA). This supports key business workflows where customers may expand relationships across multiple lines of business, such as identifying a Water opportunity for a Hygiene customer. It also ensures future scalability by aligning with the One Customer Initiative’s unified enterprise view and integrating with upstream systems like MDM and ERP.
 

 
Additionally, ERP source system logic must be reviewed and revised to support the new structure. In current-state, Water accounts have NLC_SAP as the ERP system and Hygiene accounts have ECL_EBS. Post-migration, all accounts under a unified BCA will reference the same ERP system, typically ECL_EBS. This may require updates to any validation logic or plugins that rely on ERP system values.
 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Users must be able to create a new Sales Skill Account (e.g., Water or Hygiene) and link it to an existing Base Customer Account (BCA) within CRM. 
 *  System should support creation of a standalone Sales Skill Account (e.g., as a Prospect) that may later be linked to a BCA through MDM integration. 
 *  Sales Skill must be explicitly designated at the time of account creation and must remain a required field for all sales skill accounts. 
 *  System must validate during account creation that no duplicate Sales Skill Account exists under the same BCA (based on name, sales skill, and account number). 
 *  If a BCA already exists for a customer, the system should surface that BCA during Sales Skill Account creation to prevent duplicate enterprise records. 
 *  When a Sales Skill Account is created as a Prospect, CRM should auto-identify if a matching BCA already exists (via ERP or MDM data sync) and suggest or auto-link the Prospect accordingly after BCA is created. 
 *  Sales Skill Accounts should be visible through appropriate CRM views, subgrids on the BCA form, and must allow users to filter based on Sales Skill, Account Status, and Ownership. 
 *  Role-based access should control who can create Sales Skill Accounts, particularly restricting the creation of Water and Hygiene accounts to authorized roles only. 
 *  The Sales Skill Account form should offer intuitive guidance and prefill capabilities where applicable (e.g., inherited address data from BCA). 
 *  ERP and MDM integration logic must be updated to: 

 *  Accept new Sales Skill Account records. 
 *  Align account number generation logic with the updated structure. 
 *  Return appropriate metadata (e.g., market segment, sub-segment) based on the Sales Skill and BCA relationship. 
 

 

 

 
Technical Implementation Considerations: 

 *  Sales Skill Account Creation from BCA: 

 *  Users can initiate Sales Skill Account creation from within a BCA form. 
 *  The BCA field should be auto-populated and read-only on the Sales Skill Account form. 
 *  Account Type should default to “Prospect”. 
 *  Sales Skill must be selected (e.g., Water, Hygiene). 
 *  Required fields: Account Name, District, Sales Skill, Account Type. 
 *  The new account will appear in a subgrid on the BCA form. 
 

 *  Creation of Standalone Prospects: 

 *  Users may also create Sales Skill Accounts independently without initially linking to a BCA. 
 *  During MDM processing, if a matching BCA is identified, integration will update the record with the BCA reference. 
 *  BCA field should be set as read-only and only populated through integration in this case. 
 

 *  ERP System Logic Review and Changes: 

 *  Existing logic that sets or validates the ERP System field (source system) must be reviewed. 
 *  Example: A Water account previously associated with NLC_SAP will now reflect ECL_EBS due to its migration under a unified BCA. 
 *  Any plugins, scripts, or workflows that use ERP system value (NLC_SAP, ECL_EBS) for validation must be updated. 
 *  Example: If current plugin logic enforces ERP system uniqueness or mapping rules based on account type or sales skill, those need to be revised to support multiple Sales Skill Accounts sharing the same ERP system and account number. 
 *  ERP system field should reflect the true source system of the customer data and align with the ERP master. 
 

 *  Validation and Business Rules: 

 *  Enforce uniqueness of Sales Skill + Account Number + ERP System. 
 *  Prevent duplicate records for the same Sales Skill and Account Number within the same BCA. 
 *  Ensure the BCA lookup is only visible and applicable to accounts tied to One Customer districts. 
 

 *  Form and Security Behavior: 

 *  BCA lookup field must be displayed as read-only and only visible for One Customer accounts (based on district flag). 
 *  Creation of new Sales Skill Accounts should be restricted to users with appropriate roles (e.g., Sales, DM). 
 *  Use business rules to dynamically show/hide the BCA lookup based on form state, district flag, and account status (create vs update). 
 

 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Updated CRM forms for Account and BCA with appropriate fields, layouts, and business rules 
 *  Ribbon button or command to initiate creation of Sales Skill Account from BCA 
 *  Modified plugins/scripts related to ERP system logic to support the new shared ERP structure 
 *  Updated integration logic with MDM for BCA mapping and ERP system value updates 
 *  Data dictionary update including BCA field, ERP system behaviors, and sales skill metadata 
 *  Regression test plan for: 
 *  Sales Skill Account creation (linked and standalone) 
 *  ERP system validation 
 *  Account number uniqueness enforcement 
 *  Form visibility and field behaviors

Sales Skill Mapping Mechanism for 1C Accounts,,,"As the solution team, we need to determine the best mechanism to maintain and enforce the District–Sales Skill allowed combinations for One Customer (1C) accounts. The mechanism must support real-time UI filtering and server-side save validation (for UI, imports, API/SDK, offline sync). This spike will compare OOTB Dataverse N:N vs custom intersect table and document a clear recommendation, with operating guidance for admins/ops.

 
Objectives 

 *  Identify viable approaches (e.g., OOTB N:N vs custom intersect entity). 
 *  Assess pros/cons for maintainability, governance, and extensibility. 
 *  Confirm each option can support: 

 *  UI filtering of Sales Skill by selected District. 
 *  Server-side validation at save time for 1C accounts. 
 

 *  
 
 *  Define admin/ops ownership and update process for the mapping. 
 *  Produce a single recommended approach with rationale and implementation outline. 
 

 
Deliverables 

 *  Option Comparison Write-Up 

 *  Option A: OOTB N:N relationship between District and Sales Skill. 
 *  Option B: Custom intersect entity (e.g., DistrictSalesSkillMapping). 
 *  For each option, document: 

 *  How UI filtering would be configured. 
 *  How server-side validation would query/verify allowed pairs. 
 *  Governance: who updates, how often, and required privileges. 
 *  Data model impact 
 *  Pros / Cons and known limitations. 
 

 

 *  Recommendation & Implementation Outline 

 *  Chosen approach with clear rationale (why it fits our 1C needs). 
 *  High-level implementation steps for: data model/config, UI filtering, server-side enforcement, and security. 
 *  Next-step backlog items (story titles) to implement the chosen approach.

871959,User Story,,,,,,Rename ERP Sales Skill Field to Sales Skill and Align Field Behaviors Across 1C Accounts and Forms,,,"As a CRM User,
 
I want the “ERP Sales Skill” field to be renamed consistently as “Sales Skill” across all CRM forms, subgrids, and Hub screens, and for the locking behavior and mandatory fields to be consistent across 1C accounts,
 
So that the user experience remains standardized, terminology is consistent across the system, and field behavior is predictable between Hygiene and Water accounts.
 

 
Context and Background: 
During the sprint review with business stakeholders, three key feedback items were identified: 

 *  Rename “ERP Sales Skill” to “Sales Skill” Across CRM and Hub: 

 *  The field currently appears as ERP Sales Skill on the Base Customer Account (BCA) form, Account form, and various subgrid views (Opportunities, DVD Programs, RTW/Lost Business, Value Added Services, Contacts, etc.). 
 *  To align with user terminology and simplify the UI, the label should be updated to “Sales Skill” everywhere it is displayed. 
 

 *  Locations to update include: 

 *  BCA Form: 

 *  Account subgrid – ERP Sales Skill ? Sales Skill 
 *  1C Active Contacts view ? Sales Skill 
 *  1C All Contacts view ? Sales Skill 
 *  Open Opportunities (1C All Open Opportunities view) ? Sales Skill 
 *  Closed Opportunities (1C All Closed Opportunities view) ? Sales Skill 
 *  Won Opportunities (1C All Won Opportunities view) ? Sales Skill 
 *  Lost Opportunities (1C All Lost Opportunities view) ? Sales Skill 
 *  TVD Program Section: Pipeline / In-Process / Completed subgrids ? Sales Skill 
 *  Value Added Services: 1C Active VAS and 1C Inactive VAS ? Sales Skill 
 *  RTW/Lost Business: 1C Active RTW, 1C All RTW, 1C Inactive RTW, Lost Business ? Sales Skill 
 

 *  Account Form: 

 *  Field label ERP Sales Skill ? Sales Skill 
 

 

 *  Subsegment Field Mandatory Logic (Org Accounts):  

 *  On H5 Organization accounts that belong to 1C districts, the Subsegment field is currently mandatory.  
 *  As per business feedback, this field should no longer be mandatory for 1C organization accounts.  
 *  The field should remain visible but optional.  
 

 *  Form Field Locking Consistency Between Water and Hygiene Accounts: 

 *  For 1C customer accounts linked to the same BCA, the Water account form and Hygiene account form should exhibit identical field locking/unlocking behavior. 
 *  Any field locked on the Hygiene account should also be locked on the Water account. 
 *  This should only apply to 1C F&B accounts (for now limited to 1C districts; future expansion to all F&B will be considered separately). 
 *  Non-1C accounts are not impacted by this change.

 *  Rename ERP Sales Skill Field 

 *  Given the ERP Sales Skill field is displayed on BCA, Account, System user forms and related views, 

 *  When a user views any subgrid or form, 
 *  Then the field label should display as Sales Skill instead of ERP Sales Skill across all identified locations. 
 

 *  Given the ERP Sales Skill field is displayed on CRM Hub screens or system views, 

 *  When a user loads those views (Opportunities, Contacts, TVD, RTW, Lost Business, VAS, etc.), 
 *  Then the column header should read Sales Skill instead of ERP Sales Skill.

839697,User Story,,,,,,Establish District-to-Sales Skill Relationship for Dynamic Filtering,,,"As a CRM administrator or user,
 
I want a predefined relationship between Districts and Sales Skills in CRM,
 
so that Sales Skill choices on One Customer accounts are automatically filtered based on the selected District,
 
ensuring that users can only select valid and business-approved Sales Skills for a given District, and preventing misalignment between account data and organizational sales structure.
 

 
Key points:
 

 *  Relationship type will be many-to-many (N:N), allowing each District to have multiple Sales Skills and each Sales Skill to be used by multiple Districts. 
 *  This mapping will be maintained in CRM as a master data configuration, editable only by System Admin and Ops Admin (or designated admin roles). 
 *  The mapping drives filtering logic whenever the Sales Skill field is presented in the UI — e.g., in account forms, views, and any related creation processes. 
 *  The mapping ensures no invalid Sales Skill can be selected for a District. 
 *  This is the source of truth for downstream validation logic, including defaulting rules based on the logged-in user’s profile.

 *  CRM must have an OOB N:N relationship between the District entity and the Sales Skill entity. 
 *  The mapping must allow linking multiple Sales Skills to a single District and vice versa. 
 *  The mapping is stored in a configurable table/grid within CRM, accessible only to authorized admin roles (System Admin and Ops Admin). 
 

 *  Filtering Logic 

 *  When a District is selected on an account form: 
 *  The Sales Skill dropdown must show only those Active Sales Skills linked to the selected District through the N:N mapping. 

 *  If an Account is tied to an Inactive Sales Skill Record, it should not get cleared from the Account form 
 

 

 *  When a District is changed on the account form:??? To be determined as part of the Technical SPIKE. Add this to a separate story  

 *  The current Sales Skill value is cleared.  
 *  The dropdown is refreshed to show only the Sales Skills linked to the new District.  
 

 *  Data Integrity  

 *  It must be impossible (UI or API) to save a One Customer account with a Sales Skill that is not linked to the selected District.  
 *  The relationship mapping should be validated during data migration and cutover to ensure only valid District–Sales Skill combinations exist in migrated accounts.  
 

 *  Security & Permissions 

 *  Only Ops Admins and System Admins can create, edit, or remove District–Sales Skill mappings. 
 *  Business users can view mappings but cannot edit them. 
 

 *  Performance & Integration Considerations  

 *  Filtering must occur in real-time without noticeable delay for end users when selecting a District.  
 *  The mapping should be available for integration endpoints that require validation or transformation of District–Sales Skill relationships. 
 

 

Developer Notes: 

 *  OOB N:N relationship between District and Sales Skill. 
 *  Form Logic 

 *  Apply onChange event on the District field to trigger the filtering logic for Sales Skill. 
 *  If no District selected, keep Sales Skill field hidden. 
 *  On District selection, fetch allowed Sales Skill from the mapping table and filter the drop-down list. 
 

 *  Defaulting 

 *  Default the Sales Skill from User record on Account record if District 1C flag is true. 
 *  Lock the field for editing 
 

 *  Backward Compatibility 

 *  Do not remove existing District ? Global Business logic; scope is limited to One Customer accounts flagged as Yes.

Key points:
 

 *  The mapping between Districts and Sales Skills is preconfigured in the system. 
 *  If the user has a Sales Skill assigned in their profile, it will default when creating an account. 
 *  The Sales Skill field is disabled until a District is selected. 
 *  When the District is changed, the Sales Skill is cleared and: 

 *  If the user profile has a default Sales Skill that is valid for the selected District, it is automatically re-populated. 
 *  If no default exists, the field remains blank for manual selection from the District’s allowed list. 
 

 *  Sales Skill is mandatory for saving a One Customer account. 
 *  Filtering ensures only valid Sales Skills are available — no invalid selection scenarios or error messages are required. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements:

 *  The mapping between District and Sales Skill must be pre-configured in CRM. 
 *  For One Customer accounts: 

 *  Sales Skill is mandatory before save. 
 *  Sales Skill is disabled until a district is selected. 
 

 *  When District changes, Sales Skill is cleared and re-validated against profile defaults. 
 *  When Primary Owner changes, Sales Skill re-defaults based on the new owner profile. 
 *  If only one valid Sales Skill exists for a district, auto-populate and lock it. 
 *  No error popups are required—only filtered dropdowns and defaults should guide users. 
 *  Applies only for One Customer = Yes accounts; no changes for non-1C accounts.

 *  Defaulting Behavior – Global Create 

 *  Given I am a CRM user creating a new account using the Global Create option, 

 *  When I select a district for a One Customer account, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field is displayed on the quick create form. 
 *  And if my user profile has a default Sales Skill valid for the selected district, it defaults and is locked for editing. 
 *  And if my profile does not have a valid default, the Sales Skill field remains blank but must be chosen from the filtered list of active Sales Skills mapped to that district. 
 

 

 *  Defaulting Behavior – New Account Button 

 *  Given I am a CRM user creating a new account using the New Account form, 

 *  When I select a district, 
 *  Then if my profile has a default Sales Skill valid for that district, it defaults automatically. 
 *  And the default value is locked . 
 *  And if I change the Primary Owner to another user, the Sales Skill should re-evaluate based on that new owner’s profile defaults.  
 *  If the new Primary Owner has no default Sales Skill aligned, the Sales Skill becomes blank and must be entered manually before saving.  
 

 

 *  Enablement and Filtering 

 *  Given the Sales Skill field is empty, 

 *  When I have not yet selected a district, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field should be disabled. 
 *  And once a district is selected, the Sales Skill drop-down populates only with active Sales Skills mapped to that district. 
 *  And if there is exactly one valid Sales Skill for that district, and no profile default exists, it should auto-populate and lock. 
 

 

 *  District Change Handling 

 *  Given a Sales Skill is already populated for an account, 

 *  When the District field is changed, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field is cleared. 
 *  And if the user profile has a valid Sales Skill for the new district, it should repopulate automatically. 
 *  Else it remains blank until manually selected. 
 

 

 *  Mandatory Requirement 

 *  Given I am creating or updating a One Customer account, 

 *  When I attempt to save, 
 *  Then the system must validate that a Sales Skill is populated. 
 *  Else the record cannot be saved. 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 
Developer Notes:

 *  Sales Skill field must be added to both Global Quick Create and Account Main Form. 
 *  Form Logic: 

 *  Use onChange event on District field to trigger filtering and defaulting logic. 
 *  Use onChange event on Primary Owner to re-evaluate defaults. 
 *  Disable Sales Skill until District is selected. 
 

 *  Filtering Logic: 

 *  Pull allowed Sales Skills for the selected district from the District–Sales Skill mapping table. 
 *  If multiple valid options exist, show dropdown. 
 *  If exactly one valid option exists and no profile default, auto-populate and lock. 
 

 *  Defaulting Logic: 

 *  Query logged-in user’s profile Sales Skill. 
 *  If it is valid for the selected district, apply it (locked in Global Create; editable in New Account). 
 *  If invalid, leave blank and require manual input. 
 

 *  Save Validation: 

 *  Prevent save if Sales Skill is blank for One Customer accounts. 
 

 *  Open Question for Business: 

 *  Should defaulted Sales Skill on the New Account form also be locked (like in Global Create) or remain editable?

839695,User Story,,,,,,"Ability to store and manage a list of Sales Skills (e.g., Water, Hygiene) in CRM for One Customer accounts.",,,"As part of the One Customer initiative, CRM must store a master list of Sales Skills (e.g., Water, Hygiene) that can be used to categorize accounts under the unified Base Customer Account (BCA) model.
 

 
A dedicated Sales Skill table will be created in CRM to store this information in a structured way, ensuring flexibility for future expansion (e.g., adding new skills or sub-skills without development). 

 
Each Sales Skill record should contain:
 

 *  Sales Skill Name (user-friendly, e.g., “Water”) – visible to end users. 
 *  Description (optional) – for internal clarification. 
 *  ERP Sales Skill Code (e.g., EBS or ERP code) – used for integration and mapping. 
 *  Status (Active/Inactive) – to control availability in dropdowns without deleting historical data. 
 *  Global Business – mandatory field visible to users and set during record creation; used for downstream processes. 
 

 
Ownership & Maintenance: 

 *  The Ops Admin team (to be confirmed) will be responsible for adding or editing Sales Skill records. 
 *  Other CRM users will have read-only access to this table — they can select Sales Skills when creating or editing accounts but cannot modify the master list. 
 *  Sales Skills will appear in account creation and edit screens for One Customer accounts only. 
 

 
Security & Governance: 

 *  Ensure that only designated roles (Ops Admin or equivalent) have create/edit/delete permissions for the Sales Skill table. 
 *  All other roles have view-only access to prevent accidental data changes. 
 *  Any change in the Sales Skill table should be audited (e.g., who made the change, date, what was changed). 
 

 
This design ensures that: 

 *  Sales Skills are consistent across all accounts. 
 *  Dropdown lists are automatically filtered by “Active” status. 
 *  Global Business values are user-set and always provided.

 *  A dedicated Organization Owned Sales Skill table exists in CRM. 
 *  The table includes the following fields: (Org Owned Entity) 

 *  Sales Skill Name (required, text, user-friendly) 
 *  ERP Sales Skill Code (Required)
 
 *  Description (optional, text) 
 *  Global Business (required, visible to users, option set as per existing CRM configuration)
 
 *  Status (Active/Inactive) 
 

 

 *  Security & Access Control 

 *  Only users in the designated System Admin role can create, edit, or deactivate Sales Skill records. 
 *  All other CRM users have read-only access to the Sales Skill table through the 1C security role 

 *  Ecolab -1C - UASR  
 *  Ecolab -1C - TASR
 
 

 *  Permissions are applied at the table level to ensure compliance. 
 

 *  Sales Skill table to be made visible on the Ecolab Admin App (Near Districts). 

 *  Visibility in site map to be controlled based on security role 
 

 *  Data Integrity & Availability 

 *  Sales Skill Name must be unique. 
 *  Global Business mapping is mandatory and must be visible on the form when creating or editing a Sales Skill. 
 *  Inactive Sales Skills remain in the system for historical reporting but are hidden from selection dropdowns. 
 

 *  User Experience (Move it to the Account User Story)  

 *  When creating or editing an account, the Sales Skill dropdown displays only Active Sales Skills.  
 *  The dropdown shows user-friendly names only (no EBS codes).  
 *  The Sales Skill field appears for One Customer accounts only, as defined by the “1C” flag or equivalent logic.  
 *  Global Business field is visible and required when creating or editing Sales Skill records.  
 

 *  Audit & Tracking 

 *  All changes to the Sales Skill table (additions, edits, deactivations) are logged with: 
 *  User who made the change. 
 *  Date and time of change. 
 *  Fields modified. 
 

 *  Integration Readiness 

 *  ERP Sales Skill Code field is available for integration mapping but remains hidden from standard CRM views and forms.   
 *  Data is stored in a way that supports linking Sales Skills to Districts, Global Business, and Accounts. 
 

 *  Validation Rules 

 *  Prevent duplicate Sales Skill Names and ERP Sales Skill Code . 
 *  Prevent saving a Sales Skill without selecting a Global Business. 
 

 *  Standard OOB Views should have all the fields on the Sales Skill table 

 *  Quick Find Views 
 *  Lookup Views 
 *  Active Sales Skill View 
 *  Inactive Sales Skill View

835261,Requirement,,,,,7. Validate and Correct Master Data for Existing CRM Accounts Prior to One Customer Cutover,,,,"Business Capability:
 
To ensure a successful One Customer go-live, business requires that all existing CRM accounts impacted by the F&B United (FBU) program are properly aligned with the latest master data structure. This includes: 

 *  Sales Org and District Alignment: 

 *  All Hygiene and Water Sales Skill Accounts must reflect consistent and updated territory, district, and sales org assignments per the new aligned structure. This is essential for downstream ownership, routing, and reporting. 
 

 *  User Role and Sales Skill Assignment: 

 *  CRM Users must be updated with the correct primary sales skill (either Water or Hygiene) to support segmentation, logic execution, and form behavior in the new CRM design. 
 

 *  District Flag for One Customer Accounts: 

 *  Districts supporting One Customer program must be flagged appropriately (e.g., One Customer Flag = Yes). This will support CRM form logic for displaying BCA-related fields and restrict changes where necessary. 
 

 *  Market Segment and Sub-Segment Cleanup: 

 *  The business has initiated a data rationalization effort to clean up outdated or “other” categories in MDM. CRM must reflect: 

 *  Aligned naming conventions for Market Segment and Sub-Segment 
 *  Elimination of obsolete or duplicate entries 
 *  Controlled updates to ensure non-FBU divisions (80% of accounts) remain unaffected 
 

 

 *  Manual Cleanup Now, Automation Later: 

 *  As of now, the cleanup will be a manual one-time update performed before cutover. However, business has requested future automation of market segment/sub-segment updates from MDM, which will be added to the default backlog. 
 

 

 
Technical Implementation Considerations: 

 *  Territory, District, and Sales Org Updates: 

 *  Validate all FBU Sales Skill Accounts to ensure that their districts and sales orgs align with the latest data from the territory management team. 
 *  If discrepancies are found, update CRM manually or through data repair tools. 
 *  Cross-check with the weekly load process—if it has already handled the update, validate and mark as complete. 
 

 *  District Flag Setup: 

 *  Update relevant district records in CRM with the new “One Customer” flag (Yes/No) based on the districts participating in FBU rollout. 
 *  This flag will drive downstream visibility logic (e.g., when to show BCA field on forms). 
 

 *  CRM User Updates: 

 *  Assign Primary Sales Skill (Water or Hygiene) to CRM user records to support new logic for account creation, record defaults, and access. 
 *  Ensure proper auditing and visibility of this new field. 
 

 *  Market Segment/Sub-Segment Cleanup: 

 *  Review values in CRM for Market Segment and Sub-Segment fields. 
 *  Align the data with the latest values provided by MDM and the business. 
 *  For changed naming conventions: 

 *  Avoid overwriting legacy values unless agreed. 
 *  Update affected accounts using data import or script-based data correction. 
 *  Protect accounts not under FBU scope. 
 

 *  This is expected to be a manual one-time update for Canada. Future automation will be explored but is not part of the immediate scope. 
 

 *  Testing and Regression: 

 *  Regression testing will be required to ensure: 
 *  No negative impact on existing CRM logic tied to territory, district, or market segmentation. 
 *  Reports and views pulling market segments/sub-segments remain valid. 
 *  One Customer–specific logic activates only when relevant fields are flagged. 
 

 

 
Deliverables: 

 *  Verified and corrected Territory/District/Sales Org assignments for all CRM accounts impacted by FBU. 
 *  Updated CRM User records with Primary Sales Skill values. 
 *  District records updated with One Customer flags. 
 *  Cleaned-up Market Segment and Sub-Segment values, aligned with MDM guidance. 
 *  Documentation of all manual updates performed and data governance logs maintained. 
 *  Default backlog item created for future automation of segment/sub-segment population via MDM. 
 *  Regression test scripts for impacted forms, views, workflows, and integrations.

843375,User Story,,,,,,Technical Spike: Redesign Market Segment Filtering for 1C Districts,,,"As a system designer,
I want to investigate alternative approaches for decoupling the current market segment filtering from the global business field
 
so that 1C districts use a sales skill–driven market segment filtering model that avoids unnecessary exposure of non-relevant Nalco Water records.
 

 

 
","Chopra, Ashish",PO Approved,Solutioning; TECHNICAL SPIKE,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.03,2,Moved out of state Pending PO Review,Business,6,"Scope / Objectives of the Spike

 *  Analyze the current dependency where the Market Segment table uses the Global Business multi-select option set. 
 *  Identify risks of simply merging Water into Hygiene (e.g., unintended exposure of the entire Nalco Water catalog instead of only Food & Beverage). 
 *  Explore potential design strategies, including: 

 *  Creating a direct N-to-N relationship between Market Segment and Sales Skill 
 *  Using a mapping (intersection) table for flexibility and scalability 
 *  Evaluating if native Dynamics 365 N-to-N relationships or custom mapping tables are better suited 
 

 *  Confirm how the Global Business field should be set behind the scenes when a Sales Skill is selected. 
 *  Define how filtering should behave in 1C districts (based on sales skill) vs. non-1C districts (continue current logic). 
 

Expected Outputs / Deliverables

 *  A documented recommended design approach for filtering Market Segments in 1C districts (N-to-N relationship vs. mapping table). 
 *  A clear decision on how the Global Business field will be managed under the new design. 
 *  A sample data model diagram (or pseudo-model) showing the proposed Market Segment ? Sales Skill linkage. 
 *  A summary of pros/cons for each approach evaluated. 
 *  Follow-up user stories to be created from the spike outcome: 

 *  Build functionality for sales skill–driven Market Segment filtering 
 *  Populate and validate the Sales Skill–Market Segment mapping table as part of master data setup

852357,User Story,,,,,,Establish Relationship Between Market Segment and Sales Skill for Dynamic Filtering,,,"As a CRM user creating or updating a One Customer account,
I want the Market Segment field to dynamically filter its values based on the selected Sales Skill,
 
So that the correct Market Segment is always available for selection and not incorrectly driven by the outdated Global Business logic.
 
","Jadhav, Kalyani",In Prod,CodeReviewed; FBU_QAPush_Oct_Major1; ProdPush_Nov_FBU_R1,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.05,2,Moved out of state Pending Prod Release,Business,5,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 
 
 

 *  Dynamic Filtering by Sales Skill 

 *  Given I am creating or updating a One Customer account, 
 *  When I select a valid Sales Skill, 
 *  Then the Market Segment field should display only the Market Segments linked to that Sales Skill that are related using N:N relationship. via the new mapping table. 
 

 *  Blank Until Sales Skill Selection 

 *  Given no Sales Skill has been selected, 
 *  Then the Market Segment field should remain disabled/blank, preventing premature selection. 
 

 *  Multiple Sales Skills (Water & Hygiene)  

 *  Given a Base Customer Account has both a Water Sales Skill account and a Hygiene Sales Skill account linked,  
 *  When I am creating a new account under the same BCA,  
 *  Then the Market Segment options should still filter correctly based on whichever Sales Skill I choose on that new record.  
 

 *  Validation Requirement 

 *  Given I attempt to save a One Customer account, 
 *  When no Market Segment is selected, 
 *  Then the system should prevent save and prompt the user to select from the filtered list. 
 

 *  Non-1C Accounts 

 *  Given I am creating a non-One Customer account, 
 *  Then the current behavior (filtering based on Global Business) should continue without change. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  New Mapping Table  

 *  Create a new custom intersect table Market Segment ? Sales Skill.  
 *  Fields include:  

 *  Sales Skill (lookup to Sales Skill table)  
 *  Market Segment (lookup to Market Segment table)  
 *  Status (Active/Inactive)  
 *  Created/Modified metadata  
 

 

 *  New OOB N:N relationship between Market Segment and Sales Skill 
 *  Filtering Logic 

 *  Market Segment field must be dynamically filtered based on the selected Sales Skill. 
 *  Global Business should no longer be the driver for filtering in One Customer accounts. 
 

 *  Applicability 

 *  Applies only to One Customer = Yes accounts. 
 *  Non-1C accounts continue with existing Global Business ? Market Segment dependency. 
 

 *  Mandatory Behavior 

 *  Market Segment must be populated before save on One Customer accounts. 
 

 *  Security & Maintenance 

 *  Sales Ops or designated admins should be able to associate and disassociate records. maintain the new mapping table (create, edit, deactivate). 
 *  Field-level security not required beyond standard role-based access. 
 

 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Create a OOB N:N relationship 
 *  Custom Intersect Table  

 *  Build a new many-to-many relationship between Market Segment and Sales Skill using a custom intersect table.  
 *  Use OOB or custom lookup controls to maintain referential integrity.  
 

 *  Form Logic 

 *  Apply onChange event on the Sales Skill field to trigger the filtering logic for Market Segment. 
 *  If no Sales Skill selected, keep Market Segment disabled. 
 *  On Sales Skill selection, fetch allowed Market Segments from the mapping table and filter the drop-down list. 
 

 *  Defaulting 

 *  No auto-default for Market Segment in this story; only filtering. 
 *  If only one valid Market Segment exists for the selected Sales Skill, auto-populate and lock the field. 
 

 *  Backward Compatibility 

 *  Do not remove existing Global Business ? Market Segment logic; scope is limited to One Customer accounts flagged as Yes. 
 

 *  Future Enhancements  

 *  Once Global Business is fully deprecated, evaluate decommissioning its role in filtering.

859809,User Story,,,,,,"DC: Update Master Data Relationships for PAC Codes, Technology Platforms, Applications, and Units",,," 
As a data conversion and master data analyst,
I need to update and align the master data relationships for PAC Codes, Technology Platforms, Applications, and Units across the Water and Hygiene divisions,
 
so that the opportunity-related filtering logic continues to function correctly under the One Customer model, where all Water and Hygiene accounts are harmonized under a unified Food & Beverage market segment.
 

 
Background & Rationale 
In the current CRM model: 

 *  For Nalco Water accounts, the fields PAC Code, Technology Platform, Application, and Unit are filtered based on the Market Segment selected on the Account record. 
 *  Example: When a user selects a Market Segment “FB” (Food & Beverage under Water), the related lookup values in these dependent fields are restricted to those mapped under FB. 
 

 
With the One Customer transformation, all Water and Hygiene customer accounts will align under the unified Food & Beverage Market Segment structure in CRM. 
This means that:
 

 *  The Water market segments (e.g., “FB – Water”) will be mapped or merged to the corresponding Hygiene market segments (e.g., “Food – Hygiene”). 
 *  To preserve functional continuity and prevent loss of dependent lookups, the relationships between the Water-side Market Segments and their related PAC Codes, Technology Platforms, Applications, and Units must be replicated and linked to the new or corresponding Hygiene-side Market Segments. 
 

 
This ensures that all valid master data relationships continue to function when users create opportunities under the harmonized Food & Beverage market. 

 
Scope
This update applies to: 

 *  Master Data entities: 

 *  PAC Code 
 *  Technology Platform 
 *  Application 
 *  Unit 
 

 *  Reference entity: Market Segment (Hygiene and Water) 
 *  Modules impacted: Opportunities, Master Data Tables, and Filtering Logic in CRM. 
 

 
 

 
 
","Karn, Rishabh",Pending PO Review,Data Migration,\FBU 1C\Data,"K S, Shamil",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.06,2,Moved out of state Pending Prod Release,Business,18,"Business Acceptance Criteria
 

 *  Scenario 1 – Market Segment Mapping Dependency 

 *  Given that Water and Hygiene Market Segments are to be harmonized under the One Customer initiative,  
 *  When the business provides a final mapping file of existing Water Market Segments and their equivalent Hygiene Market Segments,  
 *  Then the  master data update process must use this mapping as the reference for replicating all related records.  
 *  Create a script/package to configure the below relationship for Hygiene market segments. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – PAC Code Relationship Alignment 

 *  Given a Water Market Segment and its mapped Hygiene Market Segment, 
 *  When PAC Codes are linked to the Water Market Segment in the PAC–Market Segment relationship table, 
 *  Then identical links must be created between the same PAC Codes and the Hygiene Market Segment, 
 *  And no existing PAC–Water relationships should be deleted or modified. 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Technology Platform Relationship Alignment 

 *  Given existing Technology Platform records linked to Water Market Segments, 
 *  When equivalent Hygiene Market Segments are identified, 
 *  Then all corresponding relationships between Technology Platforms and Hygiene Market Segments must be created, 
 *  And if duplicate relationships already exist, the process must skip creation without error. 
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Application Relationship Alignment 

 *  Given that Applications are linked to Market Segments, 
 *  When new Hygiene Market Segments are created or mapped, 
 *  Then the Application–Market Segment relationships that exist for the Water versions must be cloned to the Hygiene versions. 
 *  And the relationships must maintain identical reference integrity (e.g., Application ID, Market Segment ID). 
 

 *  Scenario 5 – Unit Relationship Alignment 

 *  Given that Units (used for opportunity metrics) are also tied to Market Segments, 
 *  When One Customer market harmonization occurs, 
 *  Then all Unit–Market Segment relationships for Water segments must be copied to their Hygiene equivalents, 
 *  And verified to ensure no duplicate entries or data loss. 
 

 


 
 

 
Dependencies

 *  Business Dependency: 

 *  Business team must provide final mapping between Water and Hygiene Market Segments. 
 *  Format: Water Market Segment | Hygiene Market Segment | Description. 
 

 *  Sequence Dependency: 

 *  Market Segment mapping must be finalized before executing master data updates. 
 *  Opportunity-related filtering logic should be regression-tested post-update.

Today CRM only stores market segment name and sub-segment name (text). MDM requires both the numeric codes and the descriptions.
 
To support this:
 

 *  Add a new field ECL_ERPCode on the Market Segment table to store the ERP Market Code 
 *  Add a new field ECL_ERPCode on the Sub-Segment table to store the ERP Sub-Market Code 
 *  Populate these new fields using the mapping spreadsheet shared by the business/MDM team

843378,User Story,,,,,,Create Sales Skill Field on User Record,,,"As a business user,
I need a Default Sales Skill lookup field to appear on my User record when a 1C District is selected,
 
so that I can optionally associate myself with a relevant Sales Skill when working in a One Customer context.
 
","Jadhav, Kalyani",In Prod,CodeReviewed; FBU_QAPush_Oct_Major1; ProdPush_Nov_FBU_R1; ReadyforDemo,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.05,2,Moved out of state Pending Prod Release,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 
 
 

 *  Given a User record where no District is yet selected, 

 *  When the form loads, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field should remain hidden and locked. 
 

 *  Given a District is selected on a User record and the District is flagged as a 1C District, 

 *  When the record loads or the District value is updated, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field should become visible and editable for the user to optionally select a Sales Skill. 
 

 *  Given a District is selected on a User record and the District is not a 1C District, 

 *  When the record loads or the District value is updated, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field should remain hidden and locked. 
 

 *  Given a Ops Admin selects a Sales Skill from the lookup field, 

 *  When the record is saved, 
 *  Then the selected value should be stored and persist on the User record. 
 

 *  Given a Ops Admin can choose to not set Sales Skill on a user aligned with 1C district , 
 *  Always derive the Sales Skill from the Primary Owner field on the Account.  
 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Add a new field on the User entity called Sales Skill (lookup to Sales Skill table). 
 *  Position the field directly below the District field on the User form. 
 *  Field visibility and editability rules: 

 *  If District = 1C District ? show + editable. 
 *  If District = non-1C District ? hidden + locked. 
 *  If no District selected ? hidden + locked. 
 

 *  The Default Sales Skill field must allow only business-approved Sales Skill values. 
 *  Field should be optional — users may save without selecting a value. 
 *  All logic for determining Sales Skill on Accounts is handled in other stories; this story only governs User record field behavior. 
 *  Business must be able to review the field behavior in both 1C and non-1C district scenarios before cutover. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Implement using business rules or form scripting for field visibility/editability logic tied to District selection. 
 *  Ensure this new field is added as a Business Recommended field  
 *  Ensure District field lookups reliably indicate whether a District is flagged as 1C (may require referencing metadata or a flag on the District table). 
 *  Validate performance: field visibility should toggle dynamically on form load and on District change without requiring a save/refresh. 
 *  Regression test User form to ensure no conflicts with existing customizations or JavaScript. 
 *  Ensure lookup field filters to active Sales Skill records only. 
 *  This story is only about User record configuration; do not duplicate Sales Skill-to-Account determination logic here. 
 *  Audit logging: changes to Default Sales Skill on User record should be tracked in audit history.

843377,User Story,,,,,,Cleanup and Align Market Segment and Sub-Segment Values,,," 
As a business user,
I need obsolete or unused Market Segment and Sub-Segment values to be cleaned up and deactivated,
 
so that the CRM only reflects approved, business-relevant segment options going forward.
 

 
As a system,
 
I need to deactivate obsolete Market Segment and Sub-Segment values while retaining historical integrity for older accounts that still reference them,
 
so that reporting and data history are not lost, while ensuring new account setups use only business-approved values.

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Validate the Hygiene Sub-Segment domain and retain only values approved by business stakeholders. 
 *  Add new Water Sub-Segment values approved by the business to ensure alignment with the One Customer model. 
 *  Deactivate all obsolete or unused Market Segment and Sub-Segment values so they are no longer available for new record creation. 
 *  Ensure historical data integrity is preserved — existing accounts with obsolete values should remain unchanged.

",,,,,,
835260,Requirement,,,,,6. Allow Multiple Sales Skill Accounts to Share the Same ERP Customer Number in CRM,,,,"Business Capability:
As part of the One Customer initiative, the business wants CRM to support scenarios where a single ERP customer number from EBS can be shared across multiple Sales Skill Accounts (e.g., Water and Hygiene). This reflects the new consolidated customer structure in ERP, where previously separate customer numbers for Water and Hygiene are now unified into a single number. 

 
For example:  

 *  The surviving Hygiene ERP Customer Number will be applied to both the Hygiene and Water Sales Skill Accounts in CRM. 
 *  Despite sharing the ERP number, both Sales Skill Accounts must remain distinct for sales execution, opportunity tracking, and access control. 
 

 
To maintain CRM data quality and downstream consistency: 

 *  CRM must enforce that Account Number + ERP System + Sales Skill combination is unique. 
 *  Business must define and drive the account merge rules during migration: 

 *  If more than one CRM account exists for the same ERP number and Sales Skill (e.g., four Hygiene accounts), they must be merged into one prior to applying the new structure. 
 *  Merge definitions (e.g., survivor selection, field precedence) will be finalized later by business stakeholders as part of refinement sessions. 
 

 

 
Any leftover duplicate cleanup post-migration will be handled through data conversion activities, but the primary merging strategy and decisions must be owned by business. 

 
Technical Implementation Considerations: 

 *  Core Plugin Logic: 

 *  Modify the synchronous plugin on CRM Account entity that currently blocks duplicate ERP customer numbers. 
 *  Plugin should enforce uniqueness based on the composite key: 

 *  (ERP Source System + ERP Customer Number + Sales Skill) 
 

 *  Ensure this logic applies consistently across create and update operations. 
 

 *  Merging Logic: 

 *  If CRM contains multiple accounts with the same ERP number and Sales Skill, they must be merged into one per skill. 

 *  Business will provide merge rules and survivor logic. 
 *  If not merged, the plugin will block updates due to duplicate constraint violations. 
 

 *  Business-led data analysis is required to identify merge candidates prior to implementation. 
 

 *  Alternative Feasibility (Requires Technical Spike): 

 *  Spike is needed to determine if the uniqueness plugin can alternatively allow: 

 *  Multiple CRM accounts to share the same ERP number and Sales Skill, only if they belong to different BCAs. 
 *  For example, allow: 

 *  Account 1 (ERP #123, Water, BCA A) 
 *  Account 2 (ERP #123, Water, BCA B) 
 

 *  But block if both are under the same BCA, as that would imply duplication. 
 

 *  The spike should evaluate: 

 *  Impact on plugin performance 
 *  Technical viability of checking BCA context at runtime 
 *  Risk of inconsistent downstream reporting or integrations 
 

 

 *  Other Technical Adjustments: 

 *  During conversion, update ERP Source System from legacy value (e.g., NLC_SAP) to the new standard ECL_EBS. 
 *  Plugin should account for the new source system name in validation logic. 
 

 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Updated CRM plugin logic to enforce uniqueness using (ERP Source System + ERP Customer Number + Sales Skill) key. 
 *  Technical design document outlining: 

 *  Plugin update 
 *  Edge case handling 
 *  Merge logic triggers 
 

 *  Documented business rules for merges, including survivor record determination, field precedence, and audit requirements (to be defined during refinement). 
 *  Outcomes of technical spike, exploring feasibility of uniqueness enforcement within BCA context. 
 *  Scripts or manual processes to identify and merge duplicate Sales Skill Accounts before conversion. 
 *  Test scenarios and validation for plugin behavior under create/update, migration, and data repair use cases. 
 *  CRM metadata updates to reflect: 

 *  Relaxed uniqueness constraint 
 *  Revised source system mappings

839708,User Story,,,,,,Enforce ERP Number + Sales Skill Uniqueness for BCA Linked Accounts (1C Districts Only),,," 
As a CRM user, I need the system to allow more than one account with the same ERP customer number as long as each account belongs to a different Sales Skill, but only when the account is associated with a One Customer (1C) district, so that divisional accounts (e.g., Water and Hygiene) can be linked under the same Base Customer Account (BCA) without being blocked by duplicate validation.
For non-1C accounts, the current uniqueness rule (ERP System + ERP Number only) continues to apply.

 
Current State:
 
CRM enforces a uniqueness rule on accounts that blocks two accounts from having the same ERP System + ERP Customer Number. This was valid pre-One Customer but now blocks legitimate scenarios where different Sales Skills share the same ERP number.
 

 
Target State:
 
For 1C Accounts CRM must enforce uniqueness on (ERP System, ERP Customer Number, Sales Skill) instead of (ERP System, ERP Customer Number). This ensures duplicates are only blocked when Sales Skill is the same, while still preventing accidental same-skill duplicates. The existing duplicate validation should still work for non 1C accounts.

 *  Allow Multiple Accounts for Different Sales Skills (1C Only) 

 *  Given an Active account exists in a 1C district with ERP System = X and Account Number = 123 for Sales Skill = Water 
 *  When I create another account in the same 1C district with ERP System = X and Account Number= 123 but Sales Skill = Hygiene 
 *  Then the system allows creation and links it under the same BCA. 
 

 *  Block Duplicates for Same Sales Skill (1C Only) 

 *  Given an active account exists in a 1C district with ERP System = X and Account Number = 123 for Sales Skill = Water 
 *  When I create another account in the same 1C district with ERP System = X and Account Number = 123 and Sales Skill = Water 
 *  Then the system blocks the creation and displays: 

 *  “This ERP number is already in use for the selected Sales Skill in this 1C district. Choose a different Sales Skill or use the existing account.” 
 

 

 *  Validation Applies in UI Forms (1C Only) 

 *  Given I enter account details in a CRM account form for a 1C district 
 *  When I attempt to save an account with duplicate ERP System + Account Number + Sales Skill 
 *  Then the system enforces the uniqueness rule and prevents the save. 
 

 *  Validation Applies in Data Imports (1C Only) 

 *  Given I import accounts into CRM for a 1C district 
 *  When a record violates ERP System + Account Number + Sales Skill uniqueness 
 *  Then the import fails for that record with the error message. 
 

 *  Validation on Sales Skill Changes (1C Only) 

 *  Given I update the Sales Skill on a prospect account in a 1C district (This can happen as long as the Account is Prospect and is created from the BCA Account sub-grids) 
 *  When the change would create a duplicate ERP System + Account Number + Sales Skill combination 
 *  Then the update is blocked. 
 

 *  Deactivation Reuse (1C Only)  

 *  Given an account in a 1C district with ERP System + Account Number + Sales Skill is deactivated  
 *  When I create a new account in the same 1C district with the same values  
 *  Then the system allows creation since the prior one is inactive.  
 

 *  Non-1C Accounts Follow Current Rules 

 *  Given an account belongs to a non-1C district 
 *  When I create or update an account with the same ERP System + Account Number as an existing account 
 *  Then the system blocks it under the existing rule (ignores Sales Skill). 
 

 

Business Requirements: 
 

 *  Enforce uniqueness on ERP System + ERP Number + Sales Skill only for 1C districts. 
 *  Preserve current uniqueness rules for non-1C accounts. 
 *  Ensure validation is applied across all entry points (UI, imports, APIs, integrations). 
 *  Provide clear and district-specific error messaging. 
 *  Ensure search and views distinguish accounts by ERP Number + Sales Skill. 
 

 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Uniqueness & Validation Rules 

 *  The system allows more than one active account with the same ERP System and ERP Customer Number if their Sales Skill values are different. 
 *  The system blocks create/update when ERP System, ERP Customer Number, and Sales Skill are all identical to an existing active account. 
 *  The rule applies across: 

 *  Form saves 
 *  Dataverse API/SDK updates 
 *  Imports and integration upserts 
 

 *  Validation message example: 

 *  “This ERP Number is already used for the selected Sales Skill. Choose a different Sales Skill or use the existing account.” 
 

 *  Changing the Sales Skill on an account is blocked if it would create a duplicate composite (ERP System + ERP Customer Number + Sales Skill). 
 

 *  Scope Control 

 *  Non-One Customer accounts (no Sales Skill) follow current uniqueness rules without change. 
 

 *  Data Conversion 

 *  Data conversion loads allow multiple accounts for the same ERP number when Sales Skills differ. 
 *  If a conversion would produce a same-skill duplicate, it is prevented with a clear message. 
 

 *  UI & Search 

 *  Standard account views include Sales Skill to distinguish accounts with the same ERP number. 
 *  Global Search results show both ERP number and Sales Skill for clarity. 
 

 *  Edge Cases 

 *  Deactivating an account frees up that composite key for reuse. 
 *  Temporary absence of Sales Skill uses non-1C validation rules.

835259,Requirement,,,,,5. Align Global Business Logic Using Sales Skill Instead of District for One Customer Accounts,,,,"Business Objective:
 
 
Business expects CRM to support the One Customer model by accurately reflecting the line of business (Water or Hygiene) through a clearly visible field on the customer account — without relying on outdated or misleading metadata such as the District-driven Global Business. 

 
To support the One Customer model and present a unified view of the business, CRM must shift away from legacy district-driven global business logic, which inaccurately implies separation between Water and Hygiene. With both divisions now operating under a single go-to-market model, relying on district-based population of the “Global Business” field misrepresents the business structure and introduces confusion among users. The objective is to ensure CRM reflects a consolidated line-of-business identity through the Sales Skill designation and to eliminate user-facing dependency on outdated metadata such as “Global Business.” This will foster a consistent, accurate, and future-ready user experience aligned with the business’s strategic transformation.
 

 
Business Requirements:
 

 *  Replace existing logic that auto-populates the Global Business field based on district with logic that derives business classification from the Sales Skill field. 
 *  Ensure the Sales Skill designation is clearly displayed on all CRM customer account forms, indicating whether an account aligns to Water, Hygiene, or another line of business. 
 *  Demote or remove the Global Business field from the user interface to avoid misinterpretation; it should no longer be a visible or editable field for users. 
 *  Ensure system-generated metadata (e.g., Market Segment, Sub-Segment) is driven from Sales Skill instead of Global Business to maintain consistency. 
 *  Provide a consistent user experience across all relevant forms, where Sales Skill becomes the primary field for business classification. 
 *  Ensure that this updated behavior applies to all accounts under the One Customer structure, including those within Food & Beverage, while retaining existing logic for legacy business units that are not part of One Customer. 
 *  Avoid any disruption to downstream processes or integrations that depend on the Global Business field by computing it in the background, based on Sales Skill. 
 *  Reinforce to users through form design that Water and Hygiene are not separate business entities by removing legacy fields that imply otherwise. 
 

 
Technical Implementation Considerations: 

 *  Introduce a new Sales Skill field (e.g., option set with values “Water”, “Hygiene”) on: 

 *  CRM Account entity (visible when district is marked as One Customer). 
 *  User entity (optional default value per user). 
 

 *  Update CRM logic so that Global Business is derived based on Sales Skill, not District, but only when the account is marked as One Customer. 

 *  For example: 

 *  Sales Skill = Water ? Global Business = Alco Water 
 *  Sales Skill = Hygiene ? Global Business = Food & Beverage 
 

 

 *  The Global Business field will remain in the system but should be removed from prominent sections of the Account form UI. It should not be user-editable. 
 *  Modify existing logic or business rules that default Market Segment and Sub-Segment, which may currently be tied to District, to instead use Sales Skill as the primary driver. 
 *  Add logic to prompt users to select a Sales Skill if one is not available from user defaults. 
 *  Hide Sales Skill and related behaviors when the account is not part of a One Customer district. 
 *  Perform technical spike(s) to: 

 *  Evaluate feasibility and design of user-level defaulting for Sales Skill. 
 *  Assess existing dependencies on Global Business field (e.g., plugin behavior, downstream integrations). 
 *  Validate any required updates to district metadata or custom scripting. 
 

 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  New Sales Skill field (Account and User entity), implemented with appropriate visibility and security controls. 
 *  Revised form logic and field behavior to: 

 *  Control visibility of Sales Skill and Global Business fields. 
 *  Derive Global Business based on Sales Skill for One Customer accounts. 
 

 *  Refactored logic for Market Segment and Sub-Segment defaulting. 
 *  Updated data model documentation, including field-level metadata and defaulting logic. 
 *  Detailed outcomes from technical spike activities. 
 *  Updated solution design and test scenarios to reflect new user experience and system behavior for FBU accounts.

","Chopra, Ashish",PO Approved,TECHNICAL SPIKE,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.02,2,Moved out of state Pending PO Review,Business,4," *  Identify Enforcement Approach 

 *  Evaluate at least two options (form script vs. plugin) for enforcing both: 

 *  Minimum one active Sales Skill when 1-Customer = Yes. 
 *  Proper Global Business behavior when 1-Customer = Yes. 
 

 *  Document the pros/cons of each option in terms of UI, server-side validation, and compatibility with API/bulk import. 
 *  Recommend the preferred option and rationale. 
 

 *  Sales Skill Rule Definition 

 *  Rule that a District with 1-Customer = Yes cannot be saved without at least one active Sales Skill linked. 
 *  Rule that removal or deactivation of the last active Sales Skill is not allowed; must display a clear, user-friendly error message. 
 *  Include logic to prevent these violations during both manual UI actions and programmatic/API operations. 
 

 *  Global Business Field Behavior 

 *  For 1-Customer = Yes: 

 *  Determine whether the Global Business field should be hidden or disabled in the form UI. 
 *  Define whether the field’s value should be cleared once or left but ignored. 
 *  Ensure downstream processes do not use District. Global Business for 1-Customer flagged districts. 
 

 *  For 1-Customer = No: 

 *  Confirm Global Business field is visible and editable. 
 *  If previously cleared/hidden, define reversion behavior (e.g., leave blank, allow re-entry). 
 

 

 *  Create & Update Scenarios 

 *  New District creation: 1-Customer flag initially not visible or defaulted to No; confirm behavior when later updated to Yes. 
 *  Existing District update: validate correct enforcement when toggling 1-Customer flag. 
 *  Ensure rules work consistently for both create and update events. 
 

 *  Documentation Deliverables 

 *  Provide a design document including: 

 *  Selected enforcement mechanism. 
 *  All event points covered (form save, association/disassociation, plugin triggers if used). 
 *  User-facing error/warning messages. 
 *  Known limitations, especially regarding data conversion and bulk import behavior.

839707,User Story,,,,,,TECHNICAL SPIKE: Define approach to auto?derive “Global Business” from “Sales Skill” (while preserving district?based logic for non?1C),,,"As a CRM developer/architect, I need to analyze and recommend the best end?to?end design to set Global Business from Sales Skill for One?Customer (1C) accounts (in real time and on the server), while keeping the existing District ? Global Business logic for non?1C accounts, so that we avoid misclassification after district harmonization and maintain backward compatibility.

 
Goals / Questions to Answer
 

 *  Where is Global Business currently derived (form script, business rule, plug?in, or combination)? 
 *  What is the cleanest target design to: 

 *  trigger real?time updates on the form when Sales Skill changes, and 
 *  enforce server?side integrity for API/batch updates? 
 

 *  How will we source the mapping (Sales Skill ? Global Business) and handle missing/invalid mappings? 
 *  How do we branch logic: 1C accounts use Sales Skill, non?1C use District, without regressions? 
 *  What are the performance, security, and migration implications? 
 

 

","Chopra, Ashish",PO Approved,TECHNICAL SPIKE,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.02,2,Moved out of state Pending PO Review,Business,4," *  Inventory of current logic 

 *  Document all places where Global Business is set or validated today (JS files, business rules, plug?ins/steps, workflows/Power Automate, synchronous/asynchronous steps, order of execution). 
 *  Note entity/event (Account OnCreate/OnUpdate), message pipeline stages, and any dependencies on District. 
 

 *  Proposed target design (form + server) 

 *  Provide a recommended approach that supports: 
 *  Real?time form update when Sales Skill changes (field?level change). 
 *  Server?side enforcement on Account Create/Update (including API/batch). 
 *  Feature flag/branching: If 1C = true ? derive from Sales Skill; else ? keep District logic. 
 *  Include process flow (field change ? derivation ? validation ? save). 
 

 *  Mapping strategy 

 *  Confirm use of a reference mapping (Sales Skill table with a required Global Business field). 
 *  Define error behavior when mapping is missing (form warning + save block; server error message). 
 *  Specify who owns/maintains mapping and how it’s transported across envs. 
 

 *  Edge?case handling 

 *  District changes on 1C accounts must not overwrite Global Business; Sales Skill remains the sole driver. 
 *  Sales Skill cleared ? Global Business cleared (and save blocked if mandatory). 
 *  Non?1C path unchanged (District continues to derive Global Business). 
 *  Bulk/API scenarios covered (no reliance on client scripts). 
 

 *  Security & auditing 

 *  Confirm Global Business remains user read?only and hidden (for 1C) and is only system?set. 
 

 *  Test strategy (what to test, not how) 

 *  List the test scenarios the delivery story must cover (1C vs. non?1C, API updates, missing mapping, field clear/reset, district change, performance). 
 

 *  Deliverables 

 *  Design notes with: 

 *  Current?state inventory (components & code locations). 
 *  Mapping model & error behaviors. 
 

 

 *  Lightweight POC (optional): show form change + server plug?in path using a stubbed mapping. 
 *  Effort estimate & story breakdown for build (form script change, plug?in changes, config, tests). 
 

 *  Document Final Approach 

 *  Record final approach, trade?offs considered (e.g., business rule vs. plug?in vs. JS), and rationale.

Context:

 *  Currently, the Global Business field is visible and editable on all account forms. 
 *  With the One-Customer initiative, for accounts flagged as 1-Customer = Yes, Global Business will be derived automatically from the selected Sales Skill. 
 *  For non-One-Customer accounts (including all, non-FBU, and legacy accounts), the Global Business field should continue to appear and function as it does today.

 *  Visibility Rules 

 *  Given I am on an Account where One Customer flag on the District = Yes 

 *  When I view the form 
 *  Then the Global Business field is hidden, and the ERP System field is auto-set to ECL_EBS.  
 

 *  Given I am on an Account where One Customer flag on the District = No 

 *  When I view the form 
 *  Then the Global Business field remains visible and editable as per current behavior, and the ERP System field remains blank upon creation.  
 

 

 *  Automatic Behavior 

 *  Given I create or update a 1C Account with a Sales Skill 

 *  When the Sales Skill is selected 
 *  Then the Global Business field is automatically populated in the backend (not visible on the form) based on the Sales Skill. 
 

 *  Given I update a Sales Skill on a 1C Account 

 *  When the Sales Skill changes 
 *  Then the Global Business value updates immediately in the backend without requiring a save. 
 

 

 *  Edit Restrictions  

 *  Given an Account is marked as 1C  

 *  When a user tries to edit Global Business or ERP System  
 *  Then both fields are locked and not editable in all forms and views.  
 

 *  Given an Account is non-1C  

 *  When a user with security permissions edits Global Business  
 *  Then the system allows changes as per existing rules.  
 

 

 *  District Change Handling 

 *  Given an Account flagged as 1C is reassigned to a district that is not flagged as 1C 

 *  When this change is saved 
 *  Then the Global Business field becomes visible again and ERP System is no longer auto-populated. 
 

 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Hide the Global Business field on the Account form when One Customer = Yes. 
 *  Prevent editing of Global Business and ERP System fields for 1C Accounts (forms and grid views).  
 *  Ensure backend logic continues to populate Global Business based on Sales Skill selection for 1C Accounts. 
 *  Trigger immediate backend update of Global Business when Sales Skill changes (no save required). 
 *  Maintain current functionality for non-1C Accounts: 

 *  Global Business remains visible and editable. 
 *  ERP System remains blank at creation unless updated manually.  
 

 *  Ensure that if district changes to a non-1C district, the Account reverts to non-1C logic. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Use form-level JavaScript / business rules to hide Global Business field for 1C Accounts. 
 *  Apply field-level security or disable field properties for ERP System and Global Business when One Customer = Yes. 
 *  Configure backend plugin/Power Automate to: 

 *  Derive Global Business from Sales Skill. 
 *  Update Global Business dynamically upon Sales Skill change. 
 

 *  Ensure field locking logic applies in both forms and grid views. 
 *  Update data model so Global Business updates are always captured, even when field is hidden. 
 

 *  Scope & Applicability 

 *  Applies only to accounts flagged as One Customer impacted (configurable flag on the District table). 
 *  Non-impacted accounts must continue using the current District?Global Business derivation logic. 
 

 *  Derivation Logic for One Customer Accounts 

 *  When Sales Skill is populated or changed, Global Business is automatically set to the value defined in the Sales Skill ? Global Business mapping table. 
 *  If Sales Skill is unchanged, Global Business remains unchanged. 
 *  The derivation must happen real time on the form and server-side using a plug-in. This line needs to be revisited once the SPIKE is completed for the Market Segment and Sales Skill  
 

 *  Mapping Source & Maintenance 

 *  Each Sales Skill record must have a mandatory Global Business mapping. 
 *  Mapping must be stored in a secure reference table editable only by admin roles. 
 

 *  Validation 

 *  If a user changes District on a One Customer account, it should not overwrite Global Business (derivation is driven solely by Sales Skill in this case). 
 *  On non-1C accounts, changing District continues to derive Global Business as today; Sales Skill is ignored for derivation. 
 

 *  UI & Security 

 *  For in-scope accounts, Global Business must be read-only to users (cannot be edited manually). 
 

 

 

 *  Test scenarios: 

 *  Account creation (1C vs. non-1C). 
 *  Sales Skill change. 
 *  District change (1C ? non-1C). 
 *  Security roles for editing Global Business on non-1C accounts.

 *  Field Creation & Form Behavior 

 *  Given I open an existing District record, when the record loads, then I see a new field on the General tab, Named Is Eligible for 1C? 
 *  Given I create a new District record, when the form first loads, then the Is Eligible for 1C is set as No by default. 
 *  Given I am a System Admin or Ops Admin Leads, when I edit the District form, then I can update the Is Eligible for 1C value. 
 *  Given I am any other user role, when I view the District form, then the Is Eligible for 1C is visible but read-only. 
 

 *  Default Value & Data Repair (Added to the master data user story) 

 *  Given the 1C flag field is created, when it is deployed, then the default value should be set to “No” for all records.  
 *  Given there are existing District records with null values, when the migration runs, then those values are backfilled to “No” to avoid nulls.  
 *  Given for the Districts which are truly 1C district, this 1C flag should be set as Yes  
 

 *  View Updates  

 *  Given I open the Active Districts view, when the view loads, then the 1C flag appears as the last column and is sortable & filterable.  
 *  Given I open the Inactive Districts view, when the view loads, then the 1C flag appears as the last column and is sortable & filterable.  
 *  Given I use Advanced Find or modern filters, when I query Districts, then the 1C flag is available as a filterable field. 
 

 

Business Requirements:

 *  Add a Is Eligible for 1C(Two-Option Yes/No) field to the District table. 
 *  Place the field under the General tab of the District form. 
 *  Ensure default value = No for all new District records. 
 *  Restrict edit permissions on the 1C flag to System Admin and Ops Admin roles. All other roles = read-only. 
 *  Update existing District records: set any null flag values to No. (Added to the master data user story)  
 *  Update the 1C districts to have a value of Yes in this 1C field. (Added to the master data user story) 
 

 
 
 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Field: ecl_iseligibleforonecustomer (display name: Eligible for One Customer) 

 *  Type: Two-Option (Yes/No) 
 *  Default: No 
 *  Display as Check box in the form

835258,Requirement,,,,,4. View and Global Search Enhancements for Base Customer Account (BCA) and Account Records,,,,"Business Objective
 
To ensure clear and consistent visibility of account ownership and line-of-business (Water vs. Hygiene) information under the One Customer model, while avoiding unnecessary disruption to existing user workflows. Enhancements will be applied only where they add value—specifically in subgrid views and global search—without altering the primary account list views used by the majority of users. This approach balances usability, clarity, and adoption, ensuring that One Customer accounts can be managed effectively while protecting continuity for the 80% of accounts that are not part of the model.
 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Preserve existing account views: 

 *  The “My Accounts,” “My Team Accounts,” and “All Accounts” views must remain unchanged. 
 *  No new fields (e.g., Sales Skill or BCA lookup) should be added to these views to avoid confusion and retraining. 
 

 *  Enhance Base Customer Account (BCA) subgrid views: 

 *  All subgrid views on the BCA record must display the Sales Skill field so users can clearly distinguish between Water and Hygiene accounts. 
 

 *  Enhance Parent/Ultimate Parent Account subgrid views: 

 *  Subgrid views on Parent and Ultimate Parent Account records must include the Sales Skill field for all child accounts. 
 *  This ensures users can view line-of-business segmentation at higher account hierarchy levels. 
 

 *  Enable Global Search for BCA records: 

 *  BCA records must be searchable by BCA Account Number and Name. 
 *  Global search results for BCAs must display both Account Number and Name for clear identification. 
 

 *  Enhance Account Global Search results: 

 *  Search results for Accounts must include the Owner and Primary Owner fields to improve clarity of record responsibility. 
 *  The Owner and Primary Owner fields must be positioned at the end of the search results grid to preserve usability. 
 

 *  Consistency across account types: 

 *  Enhancements must apply equally to One Customer and non-One Customer accounts. 
 *  No duplicate or redundant views should be created; existing views must be extended where necessary. 
 

 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  View Definitions: 

 *  Update BCA and Parent/Ultimate Parent Account subgrid definitions to include the Sales Skill field in a consistent column order. 
 *  Update Account global search result view to include Owner and Primary Owner fields, positioned at the end of the layout. 
 *  Add Account Number and Name fields to BCA global search result views. 
 

 *  Global Search Configuration: 

 *  Confirm the BCA table is indexed and enabled for global search. 
 *  Ensure search results respect CRM security roles (users see only permitted records). 
 

 *  Sorting and Filters: 

 *  Retain existing sort options (Account Name, Account Number). 
 *  Validate that adding new fields does not degrade query performance. 
 

 *  Regression Testing: 

 *  Confirm that “My Accounts,” “My Team Accounts,” and “All Accounts” views are unchanged. 
 *  Validate that global search results correctly display new fields. 
 *  Test BCA and Parent Account subgrids for proper Sales Skill visibility. 
 

 

 
Expected Deliverables  

 *  Updated BCA subgrid views with Sales Skill column. 
 *  Updated Parent/Ultimate Parent subgrid views with Sales Skill column. 
 *  BCA table enabled for Global Search, searchable by Account Number and Name. 
 *  Updated Account global search view with Owner and Primary Owner fields (added at the end). 
 *  Regression test results confirming: 

 *  No changes to “My Accounts,” “My Team Accounts,” or “All Accounts.” 
 *  Correct visibility and usability in subgrids. 
 *  Accurate and performant global search results.

 *  Given the existing Global Search functionality 

 *  When Owner and Primary Owner fields are added 
 *  Then performance, filters, and security permissions must not be negatively impacted. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements:

 *  Confirm both fields are indexed and retrievable without performance impact. 
 *  Validate security roles to ensure visibility of these fields aligns with user permissions. 
 *  Test with DM and CAM personas to confirm usability and intent.

834663,Requirement,,,,,3. Establish a Connection Between Sales Skill Accounts and the BCA,,,," 
Business Objective
 
Establish a formal relationship between Sales Skill Accounts and their corresponding Base Customer Account (BCA) in CRM to provide a unified, enterprise-level view of customer relationships. This will enable stakeholders to quickly understand the complete scope of the customer’s engagement across divisions, reduce navigation effort, and improve visibility of related records through a streamlined and intuitive user experience.

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Each Sales Skill Account in scope for the One Customer model must be associated with exactly one Base Customer Account in CRM. 
 *  The association must be clearly visible to users when viewing eligible account records, with placement and labeling that make the relationship immediately recognizable. 
 *  Users must be able to navigate directly from a Sales Skill Account to the linked BCA record in a single click, without searching manually. 
 *  The linked BCA must present an aggregated view of key customer information consolidated from all related Sales Skill Accounts, including divisional account details, associated sites, and relevant cross-division activities such as opportunities and service visits. 
 *  The BCA link must only be displayed for accounts participating in the One Customer model, ensuring that users working on legacy or standalone accounts are not presented with irrelevant or confusing information. 
 *  The determination of whether an account participates in the One Customer model must be driven by configurable business rules to allow future updates without major design changes. 
 *  The visual presentation of the BCA link and related content must maintain clarity and consistency across all eligible records, aligning with the existing CRM form design and minimizing disruption to established workflows. 
 

 

Technical Implementation: 

 *  A new lookup field will be added to the Account table, referencing the Base Customer Account entity. 
 *  Relationship Type: One-to-Many (BCA to many Sales Skill Accounts) 
 *  Display Control: Read-only lookup; visible only when applicable 
 *  Auditing: Enabled for tracking system-managed updates 
 *  Population: Set only through integration logic or system admin-controlled updates 
 *  Visibility logic is driven by the District field configuration: 

 *  A specific flag or classification will be added to the District master data to indicate that accounts under that district are part of the One Customer rollout. 
 *  If an account belongs to a district that is not flagged for One Customer, the Base Customer Account field will not appear to the user. 
 *  This logic ensures minimal disruption to users working on legacy or standalone accounts. 
 

 *  Field visibility and behavior on form load: 

 *  The Base Customer Account lookup field will not appear immediately when a new account form is opened. 
 *  It will only become visible after the account record is saved and the District value has been populated. 
 *  This ensures that the visibility logic respects the One Customer flag and avoids confusion during account creation. 
 

 

 
Field Visibility Logic Configuration: 

 *  Use business rules or JavaScript on form load to: 

 *  Evaluate the selected District 
 *  Check if the district is flagged as participating in One Customer 
 *  Show or hide the Base Customer Account field accordingly 
 

 *  Hide field during initial creation; show it only after save when District is known 
 

 
Security and Data Governance: 

 *  The field will be read-only for all business users 
 *  Field updates will be system-managed through integration or batch jobs 
 *  Users will not be able to manually select or change the BCA relationship 
 

 
Deliverables: 

 *  New BCA Lookup field on the Account form 
 *  District master data flag to drive One Customer visibility 
 *  Form load logic to handle field display based on saved District 
 *  Security role configuration to ensure field is read-only and audited 
 *  Click-through functionality for quick navigation to the linked BCA 
 *  Functional documentation for business users and development handover (including form behavior matrix)

 *  Given I open the creation form, then I cannot change or override any of these locked fields. 
 

 *  Standard CRM Behavior 

 *  Given I create a new prospect, then the record is created using the out-of-the-box Main Account form (no custom popup). 
 *  Given the new prospect is created, then it is automatically displayed in the Associated Accounts subgrid for that BCA. 
 

 

Business Requirements: 

 *  Users must be able to create new Prospects/Accounts directly from the Associated Accounts subgrid on a BCA record. 
 *  When creating from this subgrid, the new account must be auto-linked to the current BCA. 
 *  Certain fields must be auto-populated and locked to ensure data integrity. 
 *  Creation must follow standard CRM create form behavior (no custom popups). 
 *  Only users with appropriate CRM create privileges should see this option.

 *  Enable + New button on subgrid. 
 *  Auto-populate and lock fields via form field properties / Power Automate / lightweight logic (no heavy customization). 
 *  Ensure BCA lookup = current BCA is defaulted and locked. 
 *  Disable “Add Existing Account” button to enforce controlled creation flow. 
 *  Account Type = Prospect (default and locked). 
 *  Security: Option visible only for users with Account create rights.

I need the Approval Comments field label updated to Approval / Rejection Comments,
 
So that it clearly communicates that comments can be provided both for approvals and rejections, reducing ambiguity for end-users.
 

 
Background & Rationale:
 

 *  Current functionality: When a user selects Work By on the account screen, two fields appear — Approval Status (Approved / Rejected) and Approval Comments. 
 *  Issue: The label Approval Comments implies that the field is only relevant for approvals, but it is also used when an approval is rejected. 
 *  Change required: Rename the field label to Approval / Rejection Comments (or simply Comments if business prefers a shorter label). 
 *  This is a minor UI label update, no change to data structure, logic, or validation required. 
 

 

Business Requirements: 

 *  Update the label for the Approval Comments field to read Approval / Rejection Comments. 
 *  Ensure that the field continues to appear only when Work By is selected. 
 *  Preserve all existing functionality: field visibility logic, data entry, and saved data remain unchanged. 
 *  Backward compatibility: existing records must display previously entered comments without loss or modification.

 *  Scenario 1 – Approval Status Selected as Approved or Rejected 

 *  Given I select Work By on the account, 
 *  When the Approval Status field is set to Approved or Rejected  
 *  Then the comments field must be displayed with the label Approval / Rejection Comments (instead of Approval Comments). 
 *  When i choose approved or reject status, the changes should reflect on save of the record. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – Approval Status Selected as Rejected  

 *  Given I select Work By on the account,  
 *  When the Approval Status field is set to Rejected,  
 *  Then the comments field must be displayed with the label Approval / Rejection Comments.  
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Backward Compatibility  

 *  Given existing records already contain values in the Approval Comments field,  
 *  When those records are opened,  
 *  Then the field label must show as Approval / Rejection Comments while preserving all existing comments.

863503,User Story,,,,,,Auto-Populate and Lock SalesOrg on Account Form When Only One SalesOrg Exists for Selected District,,,"As a sales user creating or editing an account,
I need the SalesOrg field to automatically populate and lock when there is only one SalesOrg tied to the selected District,
 
So that I don’t have to make an unnecessary selection and the account creation process becomes faster and less error-prone.
 

 
Background & Rationale:
 

 *  Currently, when creating an account, users first select a District. 
 *  SalesOrg values are filtered dynamically based on the selected District (via the Custom Intersect entity N:N relationship between District and SalesOrg). 
 *  Even when only a single SalesOrg exists for the selected District, users are still required to manually select it from the drop-down, adding redundant effort. 
 *  Business feedback from sprint demo: improve usability by automatically setting the SalesOrg field when only one option exists and prevent users from accidentally changing it. 
 *  For Districts tied to multiple SalesOrgs, the drop-down remains editable and behaves as it does today. 
 

 

","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,Duplicate,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,5,"Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Scenario 1 – Single SalesOrg Available 

 *  Given I am on the account creation form and select a District that has exactly one SalesOrg tied to it, 
 *  When the SalesOrg field is populated, 
 *  Then that single SalesOrg value must be automatically set and the field must be locked for editing. 
 

 *  
 
 *  Scenario 2 – Multiple SalesOrgs Available 

 *  Given I am on the account creation form and select a District that has multiple SalesOrgs tied to it, 
 *  When the SalesOrg drop-down is displayed, 
 *  Then all valid SalesOrgs must be available for selection and the field must remain editable. 
 

 *  Scenario 3 – Change of District 

 *  Given I initially select a District (auto-setting SalesOrg if only one exists), 
 *  When I change the District to another one, 
 *  Then the SalesOrg field must refresh to reflect the new District’s linked SalesOrgs (auto-populating and locking if only one exists, or remaining editable if multiple exist). 
 

 *  Scenario 4 – Backward Compatibility 

 *  Given I am editing an existing account record, 
 *  When the account already has a SalesOrg value stored, 
 *  Then the system must display the stored value and only enforce the auto-populate-and-lock logic if the District field is changed.

 *  Field Visibility & District Dependency 

 *  Given an existing account record belongs to a District where the 1C flag = Yes, when I open the record, then the BCA lookup is displayed. 
 *  Given an existing account record does not belong to a District where the 1C flag = No, when I open the record, then the BCA lookup and Lead Division flag field is hidden.  
 *  Given an existing account record belongs/does not belong to a District where the 1C flag = Yes/No, when I open the record, then the new ERP Account Status field should be visible.
 

 *  ERP Account Status is a Global Option Set with the following values 

 *  Prospect 
 *  Active 
 *  Inactive 
 

 *  The Existing ERP Account status field (that has Blank, Active and Inactive values) should be hidden. As part of deploying this user story to production, this old field should be deleted from CRM 
 

 

 *  BCA Lookup Behavior 

 *  Given an account is linked to a BCA with ERP status = Prospect/Customer, then the BCA lookup is locked for editing. 
 *  Given an Account is created using the Add Sales Skill Button, the BCA on the new Sales Skill account record is locked for editing 
 

 *  Lead Division Flag Behavior  

 *  Given an existing 1C account record exists, when the form loads, then the Lead Division Flag is always visible and read-only (never editable by users).  
 

 *  Form Placement 

 *  Given I open an eligible account record, when the form loads, then the BCA lookup appears in : 

 *  The Account Information section, placed before the Corporate Account field. 
 *  The Corporate Manager fields remain hidden for Nalco Water 1C accounts only (District on the Account has the 1C flag). 
 

 

 

Business Requirements:

 *  Add BCA Lookup (field type: Lookup ? Base Customer Account). 
 *  Add Lead Division Flag (Two-Option Yes/No; default = No).  
 *  Ensure visibility logic: fields appear only for accounts in Districts where 1C flag = Yes. 
 *  Ensure BCA lookup behavior: 

 *  Auto-populate & lock when created under a BCA. 
 *  Editable only when Account Type = Prospect. 
 *  Lock once Account Type = Customer. 
 *  Updated by integrations as needed. 
 

 *  Ensure Lead Division Flag behavior:  

 *  Always visible when 1C = Yes.  
 *  Default to No.  
 *  Updated only by integrations.  
 *  Always read-only for users.  
 

 *  Place BCA lookup either in the header or Account Information section (before Corporate Account) — final placement to be confirmed. 
 *  Place Lead Division Flag on the Admin tab, locked by default. 
 


 
 
 
 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Fields to Create: 

 *  ecl_basecustomeraccountid (Lookup to Base Customer Account) 
 *  ecl_leaddivisionflag (Two-Option Yes/No; Default = No)  
 

 *  Form Logic: 

 *  Add a new One Customer section on relevant account forms. 
 *  Conditional visibility based on District’s 1C flag. 
 *  BCA Lookup: 

 *  Auto-inherit BCA ID when created from a BCA. 
 *  Editable only if Account Type = Prospect.  
 *  ALways locked once Account Type = Customer.  
 *  Lock/unlock controlled by form scripts or business rules. 
 

 *  Lead Division Flag:  

 *  Always read-only.  
 *  Updated by integration layer only.  
 

 

 *  Integration Behavior: 

 *  BCA Lookup populated/maintained by integration when available. 
 *  Lead Division Flag set via integration (Yes/No).  
 

 *  Placement Options: 

 *  BCA Lookup: 

 *  Option 1: Form Header (alongside Owner/Status). 
 *  Option 2: Account Information section (before Corporate Account field). 
 

 *  Lead Division Flag: Admin tab ? locked.  
 

 *  Testing Considerations: 

 *  Validate conditional visibility (1C = Yes vs. No). 
 *  Validate BCA inheritance when creating from BCA. 
 *  Validate Prospect vs. Customer lock/unlock behavior. 
 *  Validate integration updates for both fields. 
 *  Confirm view/filter availability if needed.

834662,Requirement,,,,,2. Present Consolidated Customer Details in the BCA Record,,,,"Business Objective 
The Base Customer Account (BCA) will provide a single, consolidated, read-only view of the enterprise customer relationship, rolling up key information from all associated divisional sales skill accounts (e.g., Water and Hygiene).
 
This “single pane of glass” will allow sales, service, and support teams to quickly see the complete customer picture without navigating across multiple accounts, improving efficiency, transparency, and decision-making.
 
The BCA will serve as the visibility layer — not a data entry point — ensuring customer information remains accurate by maintaining edits only at the individual sales skill account level.
 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Read-Only Record 

 *  The BCA form will be read-only for all users. 
 *  Users cannot manually create, edit, or delete a BCA record. 
 *  BCAs will be created automatically via ERP/MDM integration. 
 

 *  Aggregated Customer Insights 

 *  Display high-level customer details: account name, account number (ERP source), parent account (if applicable), and assigned team members (CAM, District Manager, BDM, etc.). 
 *  Show linked Sales Skill Accounts for all divisions, grouped in a dedicated subgrid. 
 *  Roll up key records from all linked sales skill accounts into the BCA: 

 *  Opportunities 
 *  Contacts 
 *  Service Visits 
 *  Program/initiative records such as TVD, TSRs, etc. 
 

 *  Group related data into logical form tabs (e.g., Customer Overview, Opportunities, Contacts, Service). 
 *  In all the aggregated views display Sales Skill field to enable users to clearly identify which record in the sub-grid belongs to which sales skill 
 *  The final list of tabs and subgrids will be confirmed during design/user story creation. 
 

 *  Navigation & Visibility 

 *  While the BCA form itself is read-only, subgrid entries should allow click-through navigation to the source record for details or editing. 
 *  Maintain consistent visibility rules based on CRM security roles and account assignments. 
 

 *  Search & Quick Access 

 *  Enable global search on the BCA entity to allow quick lookups by account name or account number from anywhere in CRM. 
 *  Ensure search results link directly to the BCA form. 
 

 *  Data Ownership & Updates 

 *  All updates to customer-specific metadata, addresses, and contacts will continue to happen on individual sales skill accounts; the BCA will reflect these changes automatically through roll-up logic. 
 

 

 

Technical Considerations: 

 *  BCA and Sales Skill Accounts will have a direct lookup relationship. 
 *  However, downstream records (e.g., opportunities, service plans, activities) are not directly linked to BCA in CRM schema — they are linked to Sales Skill Accounts only. 
 *  Therefore, we require a technical spike to evaluate the best method for displaying these downstream records in a read-only grid on the BCA form: 
 *  Determine if aggregated subgrids or PCF controls can query related records using the BCA–Sales Skill link 
 *  Avoid creating complex referential relationships unless technically justified 
 *  Consider performance implications and user experience 
 *  Ensure the BCA entity is enabled for Relevance Search. 
 *  Configure the Quick Find View to include key searchable fields such as: 

 *  BCA Name 
 *  BCA Number 
 *  Legacy Account Number (if applicable) 
 

 *  
Customize the search result card layout to display meaningful metadata (e.g., name, number, status, business unit). 
 
 *  Search returns results based on name, number, and other configured fields. 
 *  Result card displays essential customer attributes in CRM global search pane. 
 

 
Spike deliverable should include:
 

 *  Prototype of read-only aggregated grid view 
 *  Performance test results for BCA load/render time 
 *  Decision matrix for PCF vs. subgrid vs. custom control 
 

 
Governance and Access Rules: 

 *  Users will not be able to create a BCA directly in CRM. 
 *  BCA should only be created via system integration with MDM and ERP (EBS). 
 *  Sitemap and navigation access to BCA will be restricted by role-based security. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Finalized BCA form layout with defined tabs and sections 
 *  Aggregated grids implemented based on spike outcome 
 *  All tabs and data presented in a read-only manner 
 *  Technical spike output documented and reviewed 
 *  Role-based sitemap visibility applied 
 *  Error handling for missing/mismatched child records in aggregated views 
 *  Global search for BCA records enabled and tested.

883657,User Story,,,,,,Update BCA Account Subgrid view to Display Approval Status and ERP Account Status,,,"As a CRM user,
I want the BCA form’s account subgrid view  to display Approval Status and ERP Account Status for every linked sales-skill account,
 
so that I can clearly identify which sales-skill records are pending approval, approved, rejected, or still in prospect state, and understand their current ERP lifecycle status without opening each account individually.
 

 
This visibility is critical for scenarios where:
 

 *  New sales-skill accounts are created under an existing customer but remain pending approval until MDM processing is initiated. 
 *  ERP Account Status remains Prospect until IF10/IF17 updates are processed, even when the account type may be “Customer.” 
 *  Business users need to quickly verify readiness for CLM onboarding or customer setup. 
 

 
The subgrid should therefore present these two fields in a consistent and easily readable format directly within the BCA.

 *  Given I am viewing the same Accounts subgrid on the BCA record 
 *  When the list of linked sales-skill accounts is displayed 
 *  Then I should NOT see CORPORATE MANAGER column in the view 
 

 *  No Change to Subgrid Behavior or Sorting Logic

 *  When the BCA subgrid is displayed 
 *  Then all existing columns, sorting, filters, and security rules must continue working as-is

This spike will explore the feasibility, limitations, and design considerations of leveraging PCF controls for this purpose.
 

 
Scope of Investigation

 *  Current limitation: FetchXML-based subgrids cannot natively retrieve grandparent-level relationships. 
 *  Evaluate potential PCF approaches for: 

 *  Displaying aggregated views with the same look and feel as native subgrids. 
 *  Supporting filtering and sorting logic consistent with standard CRM views. 
 *  Handling large data volumes and performance considerations. 
 

 *  Identify whether any existing open-source or reusable PCF controls meet the requirement, or whether a custom control would need to be built. 
 *  Determine if this approach can fit into future releases where aggregated views are needed.

848088,User Story,,,,,,Technical Spike: Evaluate Options for Displaying Related Records on BCA (FetchXML Filtering vs. PCF Control),,,"As a Solution Lead/Technical Architect, I need to evaluate whether standard CRM subgrid controls with FetchXML filtering can meet the requirement to display related records (Opportunities, Contacts, Cases, etc.) at the Base Customer Account (BCA) level, or if a reusable PCF dataset control is required, so that I can determine the most feasible, maintainable, and scalable solution for the One Customer (1C) project.
 
","Chopra, Ashish",PO Approved,TECHNICAL SPIKE,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics\Sprint 25.16.02,2,Moved out of state Pending PO Review,Business,5,"Overview:
We need to determine the best approach to display related records (e.g., Opportunities, Contacts, Cases) at the Base Customer Account (BCA) level without introducing direct relationships or schema changes (e.g., no additional BCA lookups). Two main paths exist: 

 *  Standard subgrid with custom FetchXML filtering 
 *  Reusable PCF dataset control that accepts configurable FetchXML/layout templates. 
 

 
The spike should evaluate feasibility, limitations, and effort for both approaches in a neutral, fact-based way, and recommend a proposed direction. 

 
Scope of Investigation 

 *  Standard Subgrid + FetchXML approach 

 *  Validate if setFilterXml or setFetchXml can inject link-entity joins (Account ? Opportunity, Account ? Contact, etc.) to filter by current BCA ID. 
 *  Identify if this approach allows returning extra columns from linked entities (e.g., Sales Skill Name from Account). 
 *  Confirm event options: when and how to run (onFormLoad, onTabStateChange, onViewChange). 
 *  Document known limitations (e.g., setFilterXml cannot include link-entity joins; only extra conditions on the target entity). 
 *  Estimate maintenance impact across ~10+ tabs. 
 

 *  Reusable PCF dataset control 

 *  Explore feasibility of building one PCF control that accepts as inputs: 

 *  targetEntity (e.g., opportunity, contact, case). 
 *  fetchTemplate with placeholders like {{BCAID}}. 
 *  layoutXml (columns to display). 
 

 *  Confirm PCF can: 

 *  Run custom FetchXML with joins. 
 *  Render grids with sorting, paging, click-through to record. 
 *  Support multiple configurable views per tab. 
 

 *  Assess reusability: one build vs. 10+ instances configured differently. 
 *  Estimate build/maintenance effort vs. subgrid customization. 
 

 

 
Deliverables 

 *  Document findings for both approaches: 

 *  Pros/Cons (technical feasibility, effort, performance, reusability, maintainability). 
 *  Limitations clearly spelled out (e.g., subgrid filtering cannot add columns from joins; PCF requires dev effort but is reusable). 
 

 *  Provide examples: 

 *  Simple FetchXML attempt with standard subgrid (include link-entity if possible). 
 *  Sample PCF config (inputs, fetchTemplate, layoutXml). 
 

 *  Recommendation of the approach best aligned with project timelines and scope. 
 *  Updated estimation (effort, risk, and maintainability).

Current State: 

 *  Nalco Water Accounts (ERP System = NLC_SAP): 

 *  Team Members tab shows limited roles (Account Manager, District Manager, AVP, GAM, Account Team Members subgrid). 
 *  CAM fields are not surfaced. 
 

 *  Food & Beverage / Hygiene Accounts (ERP System = ECL_EBS): 

 *  Team Members tab shows full roles: Account Manager, Associate AM/Technician, District Manager, Sales Manager, BDM, AVP, Local CAM, F&B GAM, Associate District Manager, Account Team Members subgrid. 
 *  CAM validation logic already exists: 

 *  If Parent Account (H5) exists ? populate CAM from H5 and lock field. 
 *  If Parent Account (H5) is blank ? show CAM as editable.

 *  Given I am a CRM user viewing a 1C Nalco Water account, 

 *  When I open the Team Members tab, 
 *  Then I see the same Team Members fields and sections as on a Hygiene account (Account Manager, Associate AM/Technician, District Manager, Sales Manager, BDM, AVP, Local CAM, CAM, F&B GAM, Associate DM). 
 

 *  Given I am viewing a 1C account/Prospect (Water or Hygiene), 

 *  When the Parent Account (H5) field is populated, 
 *  Then the CAM value is auto-populated from the parent (H5) account and the CAM field is locked for editing. 
 

 *  Given I am viewing a 1C Prospect account (Water or Hygiene), 

 *  When the Parent Account (H5) field is blank, 
 *  Then the CAM field is visible and editable for the user. 
 

 

 *  Given I am viewing a non-1C Nalco Water account, 

 *  Then the current limited Team Members tab layout remains unchanged (no CAM). 
 

 

 
Business Requirements:

 *  All 1C district accounts (both Water and Hygiene) must share the Hygiene Team Members layout. 
 *  CAM logic must be standardized: 

 *  Parent account exists ? CAM inherited and locked. 
 *  Parent account missing on a Prospect Account ? CAM editable. 
 

 *  Ensure backwards compatibility: 

 *  Non-1C Water accounts continue using the current limited view. 
 

 *  Users must be able to see Account Team Members subgrid in all cases. 
 


 
 
Developer Notes:

 *  Form Configuration: 
 *  Reuse Hygiene Team Members form configuration and apply it to Water accounts when District.OneCustomerFlag = Yes. 
 *  Conditional rendering logic to determine layout: 

 *  If OneCustomer = Yes ? use Hygiene layout. 
 *  If OneCustomer = No ? retain current Water layout. 
 

 *  Field Logic: 

 *  CAM field population logic: 
 *  On load and on save, if Parent Account (H5) exists ? fetch CAM from H5, lock field. 
 *  If Parent Account blank ? enable CAM field for manual entry. 
 

 *  Extend existing CAM population plugin/JavaScript to also handle Water accounts under 1C. 
 *  Security: 

 *  Field-level security unchanged. All roles with access today continue to access these fields when visible. 
 

 *  Data Integrity: 

 *  Ensure existing Water accounts converted to 1C districts post-cutover automatically inherit correct CAM values from Parent Account. 
 *  Run migration scripts to backfill CAM where Parent Account exists. 
 

 *  Regression Testing: 

 *  Validate across scenarios: 

 *  1C Hygiene account (unchanged behavior). 
 *  1C Water account (new Hygiene-like behavior). 
 *  Non-1C Water account (unchanged current behavior).

 *  Then I see all TVD records linked to accounts under this BCA where: 

 *  Status = Active 
 *  Active Stage = “4. Implemented” or “5. Final Sign-Off” 
 

 *  I should see a Sales Skill Column in the view that should help me clearly identify which TVD program belongs to which Sales Skill
 
 *  Sorted by Program Title.

 *  Each section must use CRM standard subgrid controls; no custom pop-ups or scripts are required. 
 *  Views must display only the relevant TVD programs based on defined filter conditions (status and stage). 
 *  Value-Added Services must include a view selector, defaulting to Active services, with an option to switch to Inactive services. 
 *  All displayed records must be automatically linked to accounts under the current BCA. 
 *  Sorting must default to Program Title (for TVD programs) and Service Name (for value-added services).

 *  The BCA must provide a read-only aggregated view of RTW /Lost Business linked to associated customer accounts. 
 *  The “New RTW /Lost Business ” option must be removed/hidden from the BCA interface. 
 *  Users must only be able to create RTW /Lost Business under existing customer account records (not BCAs).

 *  Ability to open or interact with opportunities follows standard CRM security model. 
 

 *  Restrict Adding New Opportunity from the BCA Subgrids 

 *  Given I am a Sales Rep / District Manager / Ops Admin viewing a BCA, 

 *  When I try to add a new opportunity from the BCA screen Opportunity Tab / Subgrid, 
 *  Then I should not have the option to create a new opportunity . 
 

 *  Given I want to create a new opportunity , 

 *  When I go into an existing customer account record, 
 *  Then I should be able to create and save the new opportunity from there, following the current process. 
 

 *  Additional Notes: 

 *  The BCA must provide a read-only aggregated view of opportunity linked to associated customer accounts. 
 *  The “New Opportunity” option must be removed/hidden from the BCA interface. 
 *  Users must only be able to create opportunity under existing customer account records (not BCAs). 
 *  Existing opportunity creation flows under customer accounts remain unchanged. 
 *  Ensure that opportunity associations continue to sync correctly with Existing Customer Accounts and BCAs, but creation is restricted.

 *  A new Section named “Contacts” is added to the BCA form on the Summary Tab. 
 *  The section contains a Contacts subgrid showing contacts related to all Sales Skill Accounts linked to the BCA. 
 *  The subgrid uses an aggregated view that displays contacts regardless of which Sales Skill Account they belong to. 
 *  Relationship logic is based on linked Sales Skill Accounts to the BCA (no custom scripts required for population). 
 

 *  Views in the Contacts Tab 

 *  Two views are available via the view selector in this subgrid: 

 *  1C- Active Contacts – Default view. 
 *  1C- All Contacts – Shows both active and inactive contacts. 
 

 *  Both views contain the same column set, but differ by the record status filter.

 *  This sorting applies to both Active Contacts and All Contacts views. 
 

 *  Filtering Defaults 

 *  Active Contacts view: shows only contacts with Status = Active. 
 *  All Contacts view: shows all contacts, regardless of status. 
 *  Users can apply additional filters in the view selector using standard CRM functionality. 
 

 *  Security 

 *  Only users with permission to view the contacts for the linked Sales Skill Accounts will see them in the subgrid. 
 *  Ability to open or edit contacts is governed by standard CRM security roles. 
 

 *  Restrict Adding New Contacts from the BCA 

 *  Given I am a district manager viewing a BCA, 

 *  When I try to add a new contact from the BCA screen, 
 *  Then I should not have the option to create a new contact. 
 

 *  Given I want to create a new contact,

 *  The BCA must provide a read-only aggregated view of contacts linked to associated customer accounts. 
 *  The “New Contact” option must be removed/hidden from the BCA interface. 
 *  Users must only be able to create contacts under existing customer account records (not BCAs). 
 *  Existing contact creation flows under customer accounts remain unchanged. 
 *  Ensure that contact associations continue to sync correctly with Sales Skill Accounts and BCAs, but creation is restricted.

 *  Given I am an authorized CRM user, when I open a BCA record, then I see an Account section on the Summary tab containing the Associated Accounts subgrid. 
 *  Given I am viewing the Associated Accounts subgrid, when I click on an account record, then the account form opens using standard CRM navigation. 
 *  Given I am in the subgrid, when I apply filters or sorting, then I can filter/sort using CRM’s standard subgrid controls. 
 *  Given I do not have access to certain accounts, when I view the subgrid, then only accounts I am permitted to see (based on record-level security) are displayed. 
 

 *  Displayed Columns

 *  Users can apply additional filters using standard CRM subgrid view controls. 
 

 *  Security 

 *  Only users with permissions to view the related Accounts can see records in the subgrid.

846932,Requirement,,,,,10. Tab Visibility and Behavior Updates for 1C District Accounts,,,,"Business Capability & Overview:
To harmonize the user experience across Nalco Water, Hygiene, and Food & Beverage (F&B) accounts in the 1C model, CRM must update tab visibility and behavior logic. Certain tabs (Customer Setup, Ship-To, Cases/TSR) should be hidden or shown based on the 1C flag to prevent duplicate or unnecessary records, ensure alignment with future-state CLM-driven processes, and deliver a consistent experience across account types. 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Customer Setup Tab 

 *  Current Behavior: 

 *  Hygiene: Customer Setup tab appears when account type = Prospect; no auto-creation on Opportunity closure. 
 *  Nalco Water: Customer Setup record auto-created upon Opportunity closure. 
 

 *  Future Behavior (1C Accounts): 

 *  For all 1C accounts (Nalco Water, Hygiene, F&B): 
 *  Hide the Customer Setup tab. 
 *  Disable automatic creation of Customer Setup record when Opportunity is closed. 
 *  Prevent users from manually creating Customer Setup records. 
 

 *  Non-1C Accounts: 

 *  Continue with current behavior (no change). 
 

 

 *  Ship-To Tab 

 *  Current Behavior: 

 *  Nalco Water: Ship-To tab visible. 
 *  Hygiene: Ship-To tab hidden. 
 

 *  Future Behavior: 

 *  For Nalco Water 1C: Hide the Ship-To tab (align with Hygiene). 
 *  For Nalco Water non-1C: Keep Ship-To tab visible. 
 *  For Hygiene: Remains hidden (no change). 
 

 

 *  Sites Tab 

 *  Current Behavior: 

 *  Hygiene: No Sites tab. 
 *  Nalco Water: Sites tab visible (multiple Ship-Tos can align with sites). 
 

 *  Future Behavior: 

 *  Hygiene: No Sites tab (no change). 
 *  Nalco Water: Sites tab remains visible for both 1C and non-1C (no change). 
 

 

 *  Opportunities Tab 

 *  No changes required (remains as-is). 
 

 *  Service Visits Tab 

 *  No changes required for tab visibility. 
 *  (Note: Sold-To vs. Ship-To logic handled under a separate requirement). 
 

 *  Cases / TSR Tab 

 *  Current Behavior: 

 *  Nalco Water: Cases/TSR tab visible (may show both Cases + TSR). 
 *  Hygiene: Only TSR tab visible. 
 

 *  Future Behavior (1C Accounts): 

 *  Nalco Water 1C: Hide the Cases/TSR tab and display only the TSR tab (to align with Hygiene). 
 *  Nalco Water non-1C: Keep current Cases/TSR behavior. 
 *  Hygiene: No change (only TSR tab visible). 
 

 

 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  Tab visibility controlled via form-level logic and security roles: 

 *  Tabs hidden dynamically where 1C Flag = Yes. 
 *  Tabs unchanged where 1C Flag = No. 
 

 *  Customer Setup auto-creation logic on Opportunity close must be disabled for Nalco Water 1C. 
 *  Cases/TSR tab adjustment: ensure TSR tab only is visible for 1C Nalco Water. 
 *  No changes required for Sites tab ? explicitly ensure visibility logic does not change. 
 

 
Deliverables: 

 *  Updated CRM account form configurations: 

 *  Customer Setup tab hidden for all 1C accounts. 
 *  Ship-To tab hidden for Nalco Water 1C; visible for non-1C. 
 *  Cases/TSR tab hidden for Nalco Water 1C; TSR tab remains visible. 
 *  Sites tab unchanged (Nalco Water: always visible; Hygiene: always absent). 
 

 *  Logic updates to disable Customer Setup auto-creation on Opportunity close for 1C Nalco Water. 
 *  Regression testing for 1C and non-1C scenarios to ensure alignment. 
 *  Documentation for training and change management.

 *  When I navigate to the account form, 
 *  Then the Cases/TSR tab must not be visible, and only the TSR tab should be displayed. 
 

 *  Given I open a non-1C Nalco Water account, 

 *  When I navigate to the account form, 
 *  Then the Cases/TSR tab should remain visible (existing functionality)  as it does today. 
 

 *  Given I open a Hygiene sales skill account (1C or non-1C), 

 *  When I navigate to the account form, 
 *  Then the Cases tab should remain hidden and the TSR tab should remain visible, consistent with today’s behavior. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Hide the Cases/TSR tab for Water sales skill accounts flagged as 1C. 
 *  Display the TSR tab only for these accounts, mirroring Hygiene behavior. 
 *  No changes for: 

 *  Hygiene accounts (Cases already hidden, TSR shown). 
 *  Non-1C Nalco Water accounts (Cases and TSR both remain as is today). 
 

 *  Ensure that all existing TSR data continues to display correctly under the TSR tab for impacted accounts. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Implement tab visibility logic on the account form: 

 *  OneCustomerFlag = Yes ? Hide Cases tab, show TSR tab (for Water sales skill accounts). 
 *  OneCustomerFlag = No ? Maintain current Nalco Water behavior (Cases + TSR visible). 
 

 *  Hygiene forms require no change (Cases already hidden, TSR shown). 
 *  Verify that role-based access does not override tab visibility (Sales Reps, DMs, AMs, Ops Admins, etc.). 
 *  Ensure data integrity: TSR records continue to display in the TSR tab after changes. 
 *  Regression testing required for opportunity closure and service visit flows to confirm no dependencies on Cases tab visibility.

 *  Given I open a Water sales skill account flagged as 1C, 

 *  When I navigate to the account form, 
 *  Then the Ship-To tab must not be visible. 
 

 *  Given I open a non-1C Nalco Water account,

 *  Given I open a Hygiene or F&B sales skill account (1C or non-1C), 

 *  When I navigate to the account form, 
 *  Then the Ship-To tab should continue to be hidden (unchanged from current behavior). 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  For Water sales skill accounts flagged as 1C, hide the Ship-To tab on the account form. 
 *  For non-1C Nalco Water accounts, continue to display the Ship-To tab as per current behavior. 
 *  Hygiene and F&B accounts are unaffected since Ship-To is already hidden today. 
 *  Ensure no residual Ship-To logic (lookups, validations) interferes with account save or update operations. 
 

 
Developer Notes 

 *  Apply form logic to conditionally hide/show the Ship-To tab based on: 

 *  OneCustomerFlag = Yes ? Hide tab for Water accounts. 
 *  OneCustomerFlag = No ? Keep tab visible for Nalco Water accounts. 
 

 *  Hygiene and F&B accounts ? no change (Ship-To already hidden). 
 *  Verify visibility settings across all security roles (Sales Rep, DM, AM, Ops Admin, etc.). 
 *  Regression testing: confirm that hiding the tab does not break related service visit or site logic. 
 *  Ensure tab visibility logic is applied consistently across main form(s) used for accounts.

 *  When the system would normally auto-create a customer setup record, 
 *  Then no customer setup record should be created, and no misleading validation messages should appear. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  The Customer Setup tab must be hidden for all accounts where the 1C flag = Yes (Water, Hygiene, F&B). 
 *  Non-1C accounts (e.g., Nalco Water legacy accounts) should remain unchanged — Customer Setup tab remains visible. 
 *  Auto-creation of customer setup records on opportunity close for Water 1C accounts must be disabled. 
 *  Ensure consistent behavior across all roles (reps, district managers, account managers, ops admins). 
 *  Users should not receive misleading validation errors related to customer setup when the tab is hidden. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Update CRM form logic to conditionally hide the Customer Setup tab when OneCustomerFlag = Yes. 
 *  Apply this condition to both Prospect and Customer sales skill accounts under 1C. 
 *  For Water sales skill accounts flagged as 1C, disable the plugin/workflow that auto-creates customer setup on opportunity close. 
 *  Confirm no orphaned workflows or background jobs are triggered for 1C scenarios. 
 *  Ensure security roles prevent users from accessing customer setup entities via advanced find or API.  
 *  Regression test: 

 *  For non-1C Nalco Water accounts, confirm Customer Setup tab and auto-creation still work as today. 
 *  For 1C accounts (Water, Hygiene, F&B), confirm tab is hidden and auto-creation disabled.

834661,Requirement,,,,,1. Support a New Base Customer Account (BCA) Record in CRM,,,," 
Business Objective
The Base Customer Account (BCA) in CRM will serve as the enterprise-level customer record, acting as the foundational anchor for associating divisional sales skill accounts and aligning with downstream systems such as MDM, CDM, and EBS.
 
The rationale for selecting Option 1 (creating a dedicated custom entity for BCA) is to minimize risk, reduce system complexity, and avoid negative impacts on CRM performance while ensuring flexibility for future enhancements.
 
Establishing a distinct BCA record will provide a consolidated, read-only view of the customer relationship at the highest level, improving visibility for stakeholders across divisions, enabling accurate data aggregation, and supporting unified reporting, customer insights, and integration consistency.
 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Introduce a new Base Customer Account entity in CRM to represent the enterprise-level customer record. 
 *  Ensure the BCA contains core enterprise-level customer metadata that applies across all business units. 
 *  Capture mandatory fields including: 

 *  Account Name (sourced from ERP) 
 *  Account Number (sourced from ERP) 
 

 *  Include optional fields for parent account reference (e.g., H5 corporate account linkage) to enable corporate hierarchy visibility. 
 *  Provide ability to associate team members/owners (e.g., CAM, District Manager, BDM) for visibility tracking and collaboration. 
 *  The BCA form should be read-only for most users, intended for visibility and roll-up insights, not for direct edits. 
 *  Ensure the BCA can support aggregated view components, such as related records, subgrids, and customer-level insights. 
 *  Establish integration readiness so the BCA aligns with downstream systems’ account structures (e.g., CDM site alignment, EBS Sold-To linkage). 
 

 
Technical Considerations:
 

 *  A technical spike will be required during the design phase to: 

 *  Finalize the list of required fields 
 *  Determine correct field types (lookup, optionset, text, etc.) 
 *  Review naming conventions and alignment with existing data models 
 *  Define form layout and security model in coordination with the technical architect 
 

 *  The output of the spike will include a finalized data dictionary and metadata definitions for the BCA table, which will be reviewed and approved prior to build. 
 *  The spike will also confirm whether existing CRM logic (e.g., plugins or workflows) will require modification to support the introduction of the BCA entity. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables:  

 *  BCA entity created in CRM with defined fields and relationships 
 *  Initial form layout and sitemap visibility configuration 
 *  Data dictionary and metadata schema updated to reflect the BCA entity 
 *  Documented spike findings and validated design for field mapping and usage 
 

 
This requirement is limited to CRM-side modeling of the BCA and does not include integration logic, which is handled in separate features. However, it establishes the foundational data structure that other processes will depend on.

834304,Feature,,,,CRM Prospect to Customer Setup Process Enablement for One Customer Model,,,,," 
This feature enables a modernized, end-to-end prospect-to-customer setup process in CRM tailored for the One Customer model. Today, CRM allows the creation of prospect accounts that follow a legacy setup flow where customer numbers are issued after setup and not linked until after validation. Under the One Customer model, the sales skill–specific accounts (Water and Hygiene) will be tied to a unified ERP Customer Number and grouped via a Base Customer Account (BCA). To align with this, a redesigned setup experience is required.

 
The feature will ensure that once a prospect is created under a flagged 1C district, the standard MDM validation flow—including address standardization, duplicate checks, and legal entity verification—is triggered automatically. Upon successful validation and business approval, the conversion to customer account will occur. The MDM system will then determine if the prospect corresponds to an existing ERP customer number (i.e., an existing BCA). If matched, MDM will link the new sales skill account to the BCA and issue the same ERP customer number in CRM. If unmatched, a new BCA will be created and synchronized back to CRM.
 

 
This capability ensures that CRM users can manage prospect creation without duplicating customers, that setup is standardized and future-proof, and that sales skill alignment and data accuracy are maintained throughout the lifecycle. The end goal is to provide a clean, unified customer footprint in CRM, MDM, and ERP while ensuring seamless user experience and data governance.
 
Key Business Goals: 

 *  Provide a clean, guided experience for creating prospects under the One Customer model. 
 *  Ensure all 1C district prospects follow a standardized MDM integration flow from the start. 
 *  Enable automatic ERP number issuance and association with existing or new BCAs. 
 *  Reduce manual intervention, errors, and duplicate customer creation. 
 *  Maintain regulatory compliance and master data consistency across systems (CRM, MDM, ERP). 
 *  Support creation of sales skill accounts under existing BCAs (e.g., add Water to existing Hygiene BCA). 
 *  Align customer setup timelines and logic between field users, MDM, and ERP teams. 
 

 
Technical Implementation Considerations: 

 *  Trigger Logic: When a prospect is created under a 1C-flagged district, initiate standard MDM API flow for validation and staging. 
 *  Validation Checks: Reuse or refactor logic to validate address, legal entity, potential duplicates, and Cisco-Libc logic. 
 *  MDM Communication: Post-prospect creation, send data to MDM for staging until customer setup is triggered. 
 *  BCA Matching: Once setup is triggered, MDM compares the prospect with existing ERP customers. If matched, send back the BCA and ERP number to CRM. If unmatched, generate a new ERP number and create a new BCA. 
 *  ERP Integration: Ensure EBS receives appropriate updates for creating sales skill under the correct ERP customer. 
 *  Prospect Conversion: Once approved, prospect record is converted to customer type, linked to BCA, and updated with the ERP number. 
 *  Account Creation Flexibility: 

 *  Option A: User can directly create a sales skill account under an existing BCA from the BCA form. 
 *  Option B: User creates standalone prospect; MDM matches and links during setup process. 
 

 *  Form Behavior: 

 *  When sales skill is selected (Water/Hygiene), logic should infer ERP system and link accordingly. 
 *  ERP system field updates dynamically depending on selection (e.g., NLC_SAP ? ECL_EBS). 
 

 *  Error Handling & Logging: Capture all validation errors and warnings for user review before submission. 
 *  Security & Visibility: Ensure proper access is granted to create and view prospects under BCA, while preventing unauthorized number overrides or duplicate creations. 
 *  Number Swap Support: Ensure new customer number is correctly reflected on sales skill account post-MDM matching or override. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Updated CRM forms and business rules for prospect creation under 1C districts. 
 *  Trigger logic to call MDM APIs from prospect creation (not just customer setup). 
 *  Updated integration to handle matching and ERP number assignment via MDM. 
 *  Auto-linkage logic between Sales Skill Account and Base Customer Account. 
 *  Rules to suppress or display BCA field depending on customer type, district flags. 
 *  Audit logs for validation steps and setup transitions. 
 *  Data dictionary updates to include new fields or logic flags introduced (e.g., Sales Skill type, ERP system override). 
 *  Regression test scenarios across CRM ? MDM ? ERP for both matched and unmatched flows.

836094,Requirement,,,,,15. Prevent Duplicate Prospect Creation Across Sales Skills in CRM,,,,"Business Capability Overview:
In today’s CRM implementation, there is limited visibility when similar or duplicate prospect records are created across business divisions such as Water, Hygiene. With the introduction of the One Customer model and unified Base Customer Account (BCA) structure, it is critical to prevent the creation of redundant prospect accounts that may already exist in another division or for the same sales skill. 

 
This capability aims to introduce robust duplicate detection logic at the point of prospect creation, ensuring that users are alerted — or blocked — from creating new prospects if a similar prospect already exists in the enterprise. This avoids siloed pipelines, enhances customer visibility, and upholds the integrity of BCA relationships.
 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  CRM must automatically surface real-time warnings or errors if a user attempts to create a new prospect account where: 

 *  A Base Customer Account already exists for the same business name or address, and 
 *  The same sales skill (e.g., Water, Hygiene) is already associated with a customer or prospect under that BCA. 
 

 *  Prospect creation should be blocked if the exact BCA and sales skill combination already exists in the system — regardless of which BU/division is initiating it. 
 *  CRM must ensure users can see existing prospects or customer records across divisions, to avoid unintentional duplication due to lack of visibility. 
 *  Duplicate detection must work both: 

 *  When creating a prospect from a BCA record, and 
 *  When creating a net new standalone prospect not linked to any BCA. 
 

 *  Where feasible, CRM should leverage MDM’s existing duplicate detection logic (via API) to enhance accuracy and enterprise-wide validation. 
 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  A technical spike is required to evaluate: 

 *  Whether MDM can provide duplicate checks during prospect creation (as it does today during customer setup). 
 *  What matching logic (e.g., fuzzy match, address match, name + sales skill + region) will be used to identify duplicates. 
 *  What UI feedback should be shown — warnings vs. blocking messages — and where (form-level, popup, or inline). 
 

 *  Duplicate checks should be triggered: 

 *  On save or form load (depending on performance and UX evaluation), 
 *  And possibly via pre-save plugin or JavaScript. 
 

 *  If using MDM APIs: 

 *  CRM must send minimal prospect metadata (name, address, sales skill), 
 *  MDM must return potential matches and optionally the customer number or BCA ID, 
 *  CRM must be able to interpret and act on this (e.g., prevent save, or suggest linking). 
 

 *  A fallback CRM-only logic (without MDM) should also be considered in case MDM response is slow or unavailable. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Defined duplicate detection rule set and logic (fuzzy name, address, sales skill match, etc.). 
 *  Updated prospect account creation forms and scripts with duplicate warning/block logic. 
 *  Optional integration with MDM APIs for enhanced enterprise-wide duplicate detection. 
 *  Configuration or development of user-friendly error/warning messages to guide users when duplicates are found. 
 *  Unit test cases and UAT support to validate duplicate prevention logic. 
 *  Documentation of matching criteria and administrative controls for refinement in future releases.

835309,Requirement,,,,,14. Enable Early MDM Prospect Sync and Conditional BCA Linking During Prospect Creation in CRM (Deferred Backlog),,,,"Business Capability Overview:
In the current CRM process, integration with MDM and downstream systems (such as EBS) only begins once a formal customer setup process is triggered, which typically occurs after the opportunity reaches a certain stage. However, for long-term lifecycle management and to align with One Customer principles, the business envisions a future-state capability where CRM prospect creation alone should automatically initiate interaction with MDM. 

 
This early sync should allow MDM to perform address validation, deduplication, and determine if the prospect already aligns to an existing customer record in EBS. If so, MDM should respond with the EBS customer number and allow CRM to link the prospect directly to the appropriate Base Customer Account (BCA) — avoiding duplication and simplifying the downstream customer setup.
 

 
This will enable tighter integration between CRM and MDM, better master data governance, and improved readiness for true customer lifecycle management.
 

 
Business Requirement: 

 *  When a new prospect is created in CRM, especially in FBU-flagged districts under the One Customer model, it should automatically trigger an API call to MDM, passing along address and company data for validation. 
 *  MDM should evaluate: 
 *  Whether this prospect already exists as a customer in EBS. 
 *  If so, MDM returns the EBS customer number, which CRM uses to: 

 *  Flip the prospect to a customer. 
 *  Link it to the existing Base Customer Account (BCA) using the returned EBS customer number. 
 

 *  If the prospect does not exist in EBS, MDM should hold the record (staging) and wait for CRM to trigger the full customer setup process later. 
 *  Upon full customer setup initiation, MDM will proceed with its standard flow — determining whether it is a net-new customer or a new sales skill under an existing customer, and interacting with EBS accordingly. 
 *  This allows: 

 *  Early lifecycle visibility in MDM for pipeline prospects. 
 *  Proper BCA linking for existing customers even before full setup. 
 *  Better planning and reduced duplication. 
 

 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  Trigger Point: Modify CRM logic to initiate MDM sync upon creation of a prospect record in FBU-flagged districts. 
 *  API Enhancements: 

 *  New lightweight prospect creation API between CRM and MDM. 
 *  Should include company name, address, email domain, etc. 
 

 *  MDM Responsibilities: 

 *  Validate and check for duplicates. 
 *  Respond with customer number if match is found in EBS. 
 *  Maintain staging record until setup is completed in CRM. 
 

 *  CRM Enhancements: 

 *  Logic to accept EBS customer number from MDM and auto-link BCA. 
 *  Logic to flip prospect ? customer if match is confirmed. 
 *  Error handling for failed match or MDM unavailability. 
 

 *  Security: Ensure proper logging, traceability, and audit. 
 *  Optional Enhancement: Future-proof by allowing delayed matching capability (e.g., if data improves later). 
 

 
Deliverables: 

 *  Technical spike to evaluate CRM feasibility for early MDM sync trigger. 
 *  API definition and documentation for CRM-to-MDM prospect exchange. 
 *  CRM workflow customization to initiate MDM call on prospect creation. 
 *  Error handling design for failed match or MDM delay. 
 *  UI update (optional): Status indicator on prospect form to show “MDM match found / pending.” 
 *  Business process documentation for One Customer lifecycle alignment. 
 *  Regression testing of standard customer setup flow to ensure no conflicts. 
 *  Deferred backlog tracking: Mark this as a post-Go-Live item unless accelerated as part of broader Customer Lifecycle Management scope.

835308,Requirement,,,,,13. ERP Source Assignment & Validation Logic Post-Conversion for One Customer Accounts,,,,"Business Capability and Objective
 
 
The One Customer model requires harmonized customer structures across Water and Hygiene. A critical capability is ensuring that ERP source assignment logic in CRM is updated post-conversion and that 1C Water (NALCO order) accounts receive the same governance checks as FBU Hygiene accounts.

 
Objective:
 

 *  Guarantee that One Customer (1C) accounts, particularly FBU Water accounts, are routed to EBS post-conversion, regardless of their global business field (e.g., NLCWater). 
 *  Maintain correct routing for non-1C accounts, ensuring they continue to follow current NLCSAP integration logic. 
 *  Enable address validation, duplicate checks, and setup governance checks for 1C Water (NALCO order) accounts, aligning them with existing FBU Hygiene processes. 
 *  Ensure a clear separation of routing behavior and setup validation between One Customer–participating accounts and the rest of the Water business. 
 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  ERP Source Update on Conversion 

 *  When a Prospect converts to a Customer, CRM must update the ERP Source System field based on One Customer routing rules. 
 *  If account has: 

 *  Global Business = Nalco Water + 1C District Flag = TRUE ? ERP Source must be ECL_EBS. 
 *  Global Business = Nalco Water + 1C District Flag = FALSE ? ERP Source remains NLC_SAP. 
 

 *  Hygiene (EBS) and non-FBU accounts ? continue existing routing rules unchanged. 
 

 *  1C Flag as Driver 

 *  The 1C flag must be the primary driver for conditional ERP source assignment logic. 
 

 *  Address Validation & Duplicate Checks 

 *  If an Nalco Water account is flagged under a 1C District and is undergoing the Customer Setup process, then: 

 *  It must undergo the same address validation, duplicate check, and customer setup governance checks that currently apply to FBU Hygiene accounts. 
 

 *  These checks must be explicitly triggered only for 1C Water accounts; non-1C Water accounts must remain excluded. 
 

 *  Form/UI Behavior 

 *  ERP Source field on the CRM form must correctly reflect ERP system assignment post-conversion. 
 *  Where 1C District Flag = TRUE, form must show ERP Source as EBS. 
 

 *  MDM Integration Alignment 

 *  After conversion, MDM APIs will: 
 *  Assign the correct ERP system (EBS). 
 *  Update the CRM account with the correct ERP account number. 
 *  Flip the account from Prospect to Customer. 
 

 *  BCA Creation Trigger 

 *  When MDM updates the account (Prospect ? Customer), and the following conditions are met: 

 *  Account ERP Source updated to EBS. 
 *  Base Customer Account (BCA) lookup is empty. 
 *  District is flagged as 1C. 
 

 *  Then CRM must automatically trigger a workflow to: 
 *  Create a new Base Customer Account (BCA) record with the same account name and number. 
 *  Associate the new BCA record with the converted Customer account. 
 

 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Workflows / Plugins 

 *  Implement CRM workflow or plugin on Account update event (Prospect ? Customer conversion). 
 *  Condition checks: ERP Source, District Flag (1C), BCA lookup. 
 

 *  ERP Source Logic 

 *  Overwrite global business–driven routing logic where 1C flag applies. 
 *  Retain existing NLC_SAP routing logic for non-1C Water accounts. 
 

 *  Form Changes 

 *  Ensure ERP Source field dynamically updates on account form when 1C logic applies. 
 

 *  Validation 

 *  Explicitly enable address validation, duplicate check, and setup governance rules for 1C Water accounts during the Customer Setup process. 
 

 

 

 

 
Deliverables 

 *  New Workflow / Plugin to update ERP Source System field on Account post-conversion using 1C routing logic. 
 *  Conditional logic for FBU Water accounts: Global Business = Nalco Water+ 1C Flag = TRUE ? ERP Source = EBS. 
 *  Form/UI update to reflect ERP Source overwrite on Account record. 
 *  Automation: Trigger creation of a Base Customer Account (BCA) record on conversion when conditions are met. 
 *  Validation enablement: Address validation, duplicate checks, and setup checks for 1C Water accounts (NALCO order), aligned with Hygiene process. 
 *  Audit trail for ERP Source field updates (pre- and post-conversion values). 
 *  Unit tests & regression tests to validate: 

 *  Non-FBU accounts unaffected. 
 *  Hygiene accounts continue EBS logic. 
 *  1C FBU Water accounts correctly routed to EBS and subjected to duplicate/validation checks.

834667,Requirement,,,,,12. Integrate Sales Skill into MDM Prospect Conversion API and Data Flow,,,,"Business Capability Overview
As part of the One Customer transformation, Sales Skill is a critical attribute that identifies the business line managing a customer relationship (e.g., Water, Hygiene). Today, CRM stores Sales Skill as friendly, user-facing labels (e.g., “NALCO Water”, “Hygiene”), which are used throughout the system for filtering, territory assignment, opportunity management, and visibility control. 

 
However, EBS and MDM systems rely on internal codes for Sales Skills, and these codes must be properly interpreted to maintain alignment between CRM and ERP systems. This requirement ensures that MDM becomes the central authority responsible for receiving friendly Sales Skill names from CRM, interpreting them via a maintained mapping, and forwarding the appropriate Sales Skill codes to EBS.
 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  CRM will send friendly Sales Skill names (e.g., “Water”, “Hygiene”) in all customer and prospect setup requests via MDM APIs. 
 *  MDM must maintain a mapping table between CRM-friendly names and EBS-required codes. For example: 

 *  CRM “Water” ? MDM ? EBS Sales Skill Code: WTR_EBS 
 *  CRM “Hygiene” ? MDM ? EBS Sales Skill Code: HYG_EBS 
 

 *  The mapping logic must be owned and maintained by MDM, not by CRM or EBS. 
 *  MDM APIs must translate the incoming Sales Skill from CRM and include the appropriate Sales Skill Code in the payload sent to EBS. 
 *  CRM must not store or manage the ERP Sales Skill codes — CRM acts purely as the originator and consumer of friendly names. 
 *  Any updates to the Sales Skill list or mappings must follow a governance and version control process within MDM. 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  CRM Layer: 

 *  Sales Skill will be stored and transmitted as a friendly label (e.g., string value “Water” or “Hygiene”). 
 *  No additional fields or lookup tables should be created in CRM to store ERP codes. 
 *  CRM team will share a mapping definition (friendly name to code) with MDM team to bootstrap and validate MDM-side logic. 
 *  No duplicate validation or code transformation logic should reside in CRM. 
 

 *  MDM Layer: 

 *  MDM will store a Sales Skill mapping configuration, either as a lookup table or configurable logic, that maps CRM Sales Skill names to EBS Sales Skill codes. 
 *  During API ingestion, MDM will: 

 *  Validate the Sales Skill friendly name. 
 *  Perform transformation based on mapping logic. 
 *  Send the correct Sales Skill code to EBS in the downstream payload. 
 

 *  MDM APIs must also expose this logic or result to CRM if required for display or validation. 
 

 *  EBS Layer: 

 *  Receives only Sales Skill codes from MDM. 
 *  No expectation of mapping logic or user-friendly labels in EBS. 
 *  Mapping and transformation should already be complete by the time payload reaches EBS. 
 

 *  Technical Spike Consideration: 

 *  A spike should be initiated to confirm whether the mapping logic is feasible in MDM and that APIs can support this transformation. 
 *  If for any reason MDM cannot support this translation, CRM may need to consider a secondary mapping layer — which is not preferred and should be avoided. 
 

 

 
Deliverables 

 *  CRM-to-MDM Sales Skill mapping document (initial definition). 
 *  MDM mapping configuration table (Sales Skill Friendly Name ? ERP Code). 
 *  Updated MDM API specifications supporting mapping logic. 
 *  Sample payloads and data dictionaries (before and after transformation). 
 *  Integration and regression test plan across CRM ? MDM ? EBS for both prospect and customer flows. 
 *  Governance documentation for Sales Skill mapping updates and ownership roles.

846366,Requirement,,,,,11. Prospect to Customer Conversion and Sales Skill Expansion with BCA Alignment,,,,"Business Capability & Overview
 
 
 
The One Customer Initiative requires a consistent, reliable process for moving prospects to customers and expanding sales skills under a Base Customer Account (BCA).

 

 *  R1 (Manual Interim Process) 

 *  Reps will continue to create prospects in CRM, but all records must be validated by Sales Ops before they are approved. 
 *  The process is manual by design: Sales Ops will review each new prospect, verify against the CLM UI, and either approve or reject the record. 
 *  A prospect BCA will only be created when the prospect is approved. If a duplicate is found, the record is rejected and linked to the correct existing BCA. 
 *  Notifications remain outside CRM (via formsite/emails), with statuses in CRM used as guardrails for visibility. 
 

 *  R2 (Future Automated Process) 

 *  The manual process will be replaced with automation once CLM APIs are available. 
 *  CRM will directly validate duplicates through MDM, create and align BCAs and sales skills, and notify Ops Admins through integrated workflows. 
 *  Sales Ops will still oversee approvals, but the mechanics will be simplified through system integration. 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 
Business Requirements 
The system must support the following business requirements:

 

 *  Prospect Creation & Status Tracking 

 *  Reps must be able to create prospects in CRM and receive a unique system-assigned identifier (P-number). 
 *  Newly created prospects must be flagged in a pending review status until validated by Sales Ops. 
 

 *  Sales Ops Validation & Decisioning 

 *  Sales Ops must have visibility into all pending prospects via a dashboard or list view in CRM. 
 *  Sales Ops must use the CLM UI to validate whether the prospect is new or a duplicate. 
 *  Sales Ops must be able to approve or reject prospects directly within CRM. 
 

 *  Prospect Approval Process 

 *  When a prospect is approved, the system must automatically create a Prospect BCA linked to the account. 
 *  The BCA must inherit core details (account name, owner, P-number) and be assigned an ERP status of “Prospect.” 
 

 *  Duplicate Prospect Handling 

 *  If a prospect is identified as a duplicate, Sales Ops must be able to mark it as rejected in CRM. 
 *  Sales Ops must then link the prospect to the correct existing BCA using the Add Sales Skill function. 
 *  If no BCA exists for the duplicate, the system must create one and then link the records. 
 *  All related data (contacts, opportunities) from the rejected record must move automatically to the correct account. 
 

 *  Sales Skill Expansion for Existing Customers 

 *  Reps must be able to request the addition of a new sales skill for an existing customer using the Add Sales Skill function. 
 *  Requests from reps must go into pending review status and be validated by Sales Ops. 
 *  Sales Ops must also be able to add sales skills directly, with their entries being automatically approved. 
 

 *  Opportunity Controls 

 *  The system must prevent opportunities from being closed when linked to accounts in pending review status. 
 *  Opportunities must only be allowed to close once the account is approved by Sales Ops. 
 

 *  Notifications & Communications 

 *  CRM must not introduce new notify buttons in R1. 
 *  Reps must continue to use external forms or email to notify Ops Admins for customer setup readiness. 
 *  CRM statuses (Pending Review, Approved, Rejected) must serve as the internal guardrails for visibility and control. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Review if New status field is needed for Pending Review, Approved, Rejected on prospect and sales skill accounts. 
 *  Automation required for: 

 *  Auto-creating a Prospect BCA on approval. 
 *  Enforcing opportunity restrictions based on status. 
 *  Auto-linking or merging rejected prospects into correct BCAs. 
 

 *  Enhanced Add Sales Skill button logic (different for reps vs Sales Ops). 
 *  Data handling for rejected records: ensure contacts, opportunities, and other child entities move correctly. 
 *  CLM API integration deferred to R2, but design must anticipate eventual automation. 
 

 

 

 
Deliverables 

 *  Updated CRM workflow for prospect creation, validation, approval, and rejection. 
 *  Prospect BCA automation upon approval. 
 *  Add Sales Skill functionality aligned with role-based differences (Rep vs Ops). 
 *  Opportunity closure restrictions tied to account status. 
 *  Sales Ops dashboards for monitoring pending prospects. 
 *  Documentation for: 

 *  R1 Manual Process (with external forms/emails). 
 *  R2 Automation Roadmap (CLM API integration). 
 

 *  User training guides for Reps and Sales Ops.

 *  Ensure all current columns and formatting in the view remain unchanged. 
 *  Confirm that existing users of this view (Sales Ops, BU Admins for Europe and other regions) continue to see the same information for non-1C districts. 
 *  Ensure that 1C districts leverage the dedicated 1C Prospect Accounts Pending Approval view that has already been created. 
 *  Prevent overlap: no 1C accounts should show in both views simultaneously. 
 

 
Developer Notes 

 *  Existing view: Prospect Accounts Pending Approval (system view). 
 *  Update filter criteria to exclude records where District = 1C flagged districts. 
 *  Do not remove or alter columns in the existing view. 
 *  Cross-check alignment with the newly created view 1C Prospect Accounts Pending Approval to ensure no duplication of records. 
 *  Confirm that BQ District Manager column continues to appear in the existing (non-1C) view. 
 *  Regression test to confirm: 

 *  1C accounts appear only in the 1C-specific view. 
 *  Non-1C accounts remain unaffected in the legacy view.

 *  Button Visibility – 1C Only 

 *  Given I open a Sales Skill account of type Prospect or Customer, 
 *  When the district is flagged as 1C = Yes, 
 *  Then I should see the “Add Sales Skill” button in the command bar or form actions.  
 *  And if both Water and Hygiene Sales Skill accounts are already linked to the BCA, 
 *  Then the button must be hidden. 
 *  And for non-1C districts, the button must never be visible. 
 

 *  Dialog Launch & Owner Selection 

 *  Given I click the “Add Sales Skill” button, 
 *  When the dialog opens, 
 *  And it must display a dropdown of potential Primary owners: 

 *  Default = logged-in user. 
 *  Filtered list = all users in the related district team ( to which customer is aligned) + North America BDMs. Reps should only see the District Team members in the Dropdowns. Only BDM's should be able to see the BDM's in the Drop Downs along with the District Team members  
 *  Search must be supported. 
 

 

 *  Dialog Options 

 *  Given the dialog is open, 
 *  When I select an owner and click Submit, 
 *  Then the system must automatically open the new record in a full CRM form view, showing the cloned data with the newly set ownership and Sales Skill. 
 *  Then the dialog must call the backend API (from previous story) to clone the Sales Skill account, passing the selected owner ID.  
 *  When I click Cancel, 
 *  Then no action is taken and the dialog closes. 
 

 *  Post-Submit Behavior  

 *  Given I successfully submit the dialog, 
 *  Then the system must automatically open the new record in a full CRM form view, showing the cloned data with the newly set ownership and Sales Skill.  
 *  As an AM/DM, i should not be able to make any changes to the newly created record apart from Primary Owner. 
 

 *  Error Handling 

 *  Given the API fails or cannot create the record, 
 *  Then I must see a clear error message indicating the issue.
 
 

 

 

 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Implement button logic in CRM command bar ? launch custom HTML web resource dialog. 
 *  Reuse CRM styling/CSS for consistency. 
 *  Dropdown population logic: 

 *  Query users linked to BCA team. 
 *  Include BDMs regardless of team membership. 
 

 *  Pass selected owner ID + source account ID to backend API. 
 *  Backend API returns GUID of new Sales Skill account. 
 *  Use Xrm.Navigation.openForm (or equivalent) to open new record by GUID. 
 *  Ensure client-side error handling if API fails. 
 *  Test end-to-end flow: visibility ? dialog ? owner selection ? record creation ? form open.

867241,User Story,,,,,,Rename System View “1C – Prospect Account Pending Approval” to “1C – Prospect / Customer Account Pending Approval” and Update Filter Logic,,," 
As a CRM Administrator, I need to rename the existing system view currently titled “1C – Prospect Account Pending Approval” to “1C – Prospect / Customer Account Pending Approval”, and also update its filter criteria to include both Prospect and Customer account types so that approvers and business users can view all One Customer (1C) accounts that are pending approval, regardless of account type.

 
Currently, the view is restricted to only Prospect-type accounts with “Pending for Approval” status.
 
With the One Customer enhancements, Customer-type accounts created through the “Add Sales Skill” process can also enter the Pending for Approval status and must be visible in the same approval view.
 

 
The change should ensure that approvers have a unified view showing both Prospect and Customer records awaiting approval, without altering any other filters or layout configurations.
 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Locate the existing system view named “1C – Prospect Account Pending Approval.” 
 *  Rename the view to “1C – Prospect / Customer Account Pending Approval.” 
 *  Update the filter logic as follows: 

 *  Existing filter (current): 
 *  Account Status = Active 
 *  Approval Status = Pending for Approval 
 *  Account Type = Prospect 
 *  Related District ? Contains Data 
 *  Related District ? Eligible for One Customer = Yes 
 

 *  Updated filter (new): 

 *  Account Status = Active 
 *  Approval Status = Pending for Approval 
 *  Account Type = Prospect OR Customer 
 *  Related District ? Contains Data 
 *  Related District ? Eligible for One Customer = Yes 
 

 *  Keep all existing view columns, sorting, and security roles unchanged. 
 *  Ensure the view continues to appear under the correct navigation area for Sales, Approvals, or Account Management. 
 *  Verify that the updated view continues to display only accounts belonging to One Customer (1C) districts. 
 *  Confirm that the view name and updated logic are deployed consistently across all environments (Dev, Test, UAT, and Production).

 *  Given the system currently contains the view “1C – Prospect Account Pending Approval” 

 *  When the view is renamed 
 *  Then it must appear in CRM as “1C – Prospect / Customer Account Pending Approval.” 
 

 *  Given the view’s filter logic currently restricts results to Account Type = Prospect 

 *  When the filter condition is updated 
 *  Then the results should show both Prospect and Customer accounts pending approval, and no other functionality, columns, or layout should change. 
 

 *  Given the system currently contains the view “1C – Prospect Accounts Rejected” 

 *  When the view is renamed 
 *  Then it must appear in CRM as “1C – Prospect / Customer Accounts Rejected” 
 

 

 *  Given an account is not in a 1C-eligible district or does not meet approval criteria 

 *  When the view is refreshed 
 *  Then it must not appear in the results.

846668,User Story,,,,,,Provide Reps a “Send for Setup” Button to Notify Ops Admin Teams for Prospect or Sales Skill Setup in 1C Districts,,,"As a sales rep, district manager, or account manager in a 1C district,
I want the ability to click a “Send for Setup” button on a Sales Skill Account record (account type = prospect or customer),
 
So that I can notify Ops Admin or BU Admin teams to take the necessary setup actions in CLM (manually in R1, automated in R2).
 

 
This button must:
 

 *  Be visible only for 1C districts (hidden for non-1C). 
 *  Send a notification to Ops Admin/BU Admin teams when clicked. 
 *  Display different messages depending on the ERP status and number type (P-number vs CLM number vs ERP number). 
 *  Hide itself (or show a “notification already sent” message) after the notification is triggered, with the ability for the user to override and resend if truly necessary. 
 *  Be future-proof for R2 where the same button will trigger the automated CLM API integration instead of sending only an email. 
 

 
 
 
","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Scenario 1 – Prospect BCA (ERP Status = Prospect, Number = P-number): 

 *  Given I am on a Sales Skill Account linked to a Prospect BCA with a P-number 

 *  When I click “Send for Setup” 
 *  Then an email notification is sent to Ops Admin/BU Admin team with the message: 

 *  “New prospect requires setup in CLM. Please create this account in CLM and update the CLM number in CRM once available.” 
 

 

 

 *  Scenario 2 – Prospect BCA (ERP Status = Prospect, Number = CLM number): 

 *  Given I am on a Sales Skill Account linked to a Prospect BCA with a CLM number 

 *  When I click “Send for Setup” 
 *  Then an email notification is sent to Ops Admin/BU Admin team with the message: 

 *  “New sales skill requires setup in CLM for an existing prospect. Please initiate the sales skill addition in CLM.” 
 

 

 

 *  Scenario 3 – Customer BCA (ERP Status = Customer, ERP number present): 

 *  Given I am on a Sales Skill Account linked to a Customer BCA 

 *  When I click “Send for Setup” 
 *  Then an email notification is sent to Ops Admin/BU Admin team with the message: 

 *  “New sales skill requires setup in CLM for an existing customer. Please initiate the sales skill addition in CLM.” 
 

 

 

 *  Post Notification Behavior: 

 *  Given I have clicked “Send for Setup” 

 *  Then the button is hidden OR shows a message “Notification already sent on . Do you want to send again?” 
 *  And if I choose to resend, a new notification is sent and the date is updated. 
 

 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  The “Send for Setup” button must: 

 *  Be visible only for 1C districts. 
 *  Be accessible to Sales Rep, District Manager, Account Manager, and Ops Admin roles. 
 *  Trigger different notification templates based on ERP status and number type. 
 *  Record the date and time of notification sent for audit and duplicate prevention. 
 *  Prevent duplicate notifications unless the user explicitly chooses to resend. 
 

 *  The notification must always go to a predefined Ops Admin/BU Admin distribution list. 
 *  Messaging must be short, clear, and business-friendly — avoid technical jargon like CLM, ERP, API in user-facing UI. 
 *  R1 = Email notification. 
 *  R2 = Automated CLM API call using the same button.(Not in scope for this user story) 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Button placement: on Sales Skill Account form ribbon (visible for 1C only). 
 *  Role-based visibility: implement via security roles & form logic. 
 *  Notification logic: 

 *  R1: Send email using CRM workflow / Power Automate flow to Ops Admin DL. 
 *  R2: Replace email action with API call to CLM service. (Not in scope for this user story) 
 

 *  Implement flag field (e.g., NotificationSent = Yes/No + DateTime) on Sales Skill Account to track and prevent duplicates. 
 *  For resend: if flag exists, show confirmation prompt before resending. 
 *  Ensure button label “Send for Setup” remains unchanged between R1 and R2 for continuity.  
 *  Notification templates should be stored centrally (configurable for future edits).

 *  Prospect Creation by Sales Rep 

 *  Given I am a Sales Rep creating a prospect account in a 1C district, 

 *  When I save the record, 
 *  Then the system must set the Approval status to Pending For Approval. 
 

 

 *  Prospect Creation by Sales Ops 

 *  Given I am a Sales Ops user creating a prospect account in a 1C district, 

 *  I see the Approval Tab visible on the Account form 
 *  When I save the record, 
 *  Then the system must set the Approval status to Pending For Approval. 
 *  I can go to the Approval tab and set the Worked By Field and the Approval status to Approved.

 *  Given I am a Sales Ops viewing a prospect account in a 1C district, 

 *  I see the Approval Tab visible on the Account form 
 *  I can go to the Approval tab and set the Worked By Field and the Approval status to either Approved/Rejected. 
 

 

 

 

 *  Non-1C District Accounts 

 *  Given I am creating a prospect in a non-1C district  , 

 *  When I save the record, 
 *  Then the record should follow the existing CRM logic with no Pending Review step. 
 *  The current show and hide functionality for the Approval Tab should remain unchanged  
 

 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  All new prospects created in 1C districts by Sales Reps must default to Pending For Approval. 
 *  Prospects created by Sales Ops in 1C districts default directly to Pending For Approval but Sales ops should have ability to Approve/Reject them using the Approval Tab functionality. 
 *  Prospects in non-1C districts are unaffected; continue with current CRM behavior. 
 *  No duplicate detection or approval/rejection logic is included here (separate stories cover those). 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Evaluate whether to: 

 *  Extend the existing Prospect Status field with new values (Pending for Approval, Approved), or 
 *  Create a new custom field for prospect review status. 
 

 *  Apply logic only where District.1CFlag = Yes. 
 *  Build conditional defaulting: 

 *  If created by Sales Rep ? Pending for Approval. 
 *  If created by Sales Ops ? Approved. 
 

 *  Regression test to confirm: 

 *  Non-1C districts remain unchanged. 
 *  Prospect status correctly defaults based on creator role.

 *  And the account type should be updated to Customer on all other Sales Skill Accounts linked to that BCA. 
 *  And the ERP System should be updated to ECL_EBS on all Sales Skill Accounts linked to that BCA. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 3 – Account Number Updated on Non-1C District Account: 

 *  Given I am on a Sales Skill Account in a non-1C district, 

 *  When the account number field is updated, 
 *  Then no propagation occurs and only that Account is updated. 
 

 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Updates must propagate automatically without manual intervention. 
 *  The propagation must happen in real-time (immediately upon save/update of account number). 
 *  Applicable only for 1C districts. 
 *  Ensure data consistency: all linked Sales Skill Accounts under the same BCA must share the same account number as the BCA. 
 *  BCA ERP Status and the Account Type should always be in sync 
 *  Protect against partial updates: if propagation fails mid-way, system must log an error and retry. 
 *  Non-1C records should retain current behavior (no changes, no propagation). 
 

 

 
Developer Notes:

 *  Implement via CRM plugin/flow/Power Automate triggered on update of Account Number field in Sales Skill Account entity. 
 *  Logic: 

 *  Detect if Sales Skill Account belongs to a 1C district (check district “One Customer” flag). 
 *  Identify the linked BCA record. 
 *  Update BCA AccountNumber field with new value. 
 *  Update all other Sales Skill Accounts linked to that BCA with the same value. 
 

 *  Error handling: 

 *  Ensure transactional integrity — either all updates succeed, or none. 
 *  Log failures in error tracking for remediation. 
 

 *  R1: Triggered when Ops Admin manually enters account number or updates it post-CLM setup. 
 *  R2: Triggered when CLM/ERP integration automatically updates account number via interface. 
 *  Maintain an audit trail (modified by, modified on) for all records updated. 
 *  Confirm that existing duplicate detection rules for account numbers still function as expected (don’t bypass them).

So that all prospect sales skill accounts tied to a 1C Prospect BCA share the same prospect number, ensuring data consistency and avoiding duplicate P-numbers.

",,Removed,Discuss,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Moved out of state Rejected,Business,4,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 

 *  Scenario 1 – Sales Skill Account Under Prospect BCA (1C District) 

 *  Given I create a new Sales Skill Account (Account Type = Prospect) under an existing Prospect BCA in a 1C district 

 *  When I save the new account 
 *  Then the account must inherit the prospect number from the BCA instead of generating a new one. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 2 – Sales Skill Account Without BCA Link (1C District) 

 *  Given I create a new Sales Skill Account (Account Type = Prospect) in a 1C district that is not linked to a BCA 

 *  When I save the account 
 *  Then CRM must generate a new unique P-number as per today’s logic. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 3 – Non-1C Districts 

 *  Given I create a new Sales Skill Account (Account Type = Prospect) in a district where the 1C flag = No 

 *  When I save the account 
 *  Then CRM must use the current P-number generation logic only (no inheritance from BCA). 
 

 

 *  Scenario 4 – Data Integrity Validation  

 *  Given I attempt to manually override a prospect number on a Sales Skill Account (Account Type = Prospect) linked to a 1C Prospect BCA  

 *  When I try to save changes  
 *  Then CRM must prevent the override and enforce consistency with the Prospect BCA’s assigned number.  
 

 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  This rule applies only for 1C districts (1C flag = Yes). 
 *  For 1C districts: 

 *  If the Sales Skill Account (Account Type = Prospect) is linked to a Prospect BCA ? Inherit BCA’s prospect number. 
 *  If it is not linked ? Generate new P-number. 
 

 *  For non-1C districts: continue existing CRM logic with no change. 
 *  Enforce one Prospect BCA = one P-number across all linked Sales Skill Accounts (Account Type = Prospect). 
 *  Ensure clean mapping at cutover: all 1C prospects must be tied to Prospect BCAs with the correct P-number inheritance. 
 *  Duplicate number detection handled separately (cross-reference existing duplicate detection user story). 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Modify CRM prospect number generation logic: 

 *  Add conditional check for 1C district flag. 
 *  If 1C flag = Yes + BCA linked ? Inherit P-number. 
 *  If 1C flag = Yes + no BCA link ? Generate new unique P-number. 
 *  If 1C flag = No ? Retain current logic. 
 

 *  Prevent manual override: 

 *  Apply save-time validation for accounts tied to 1C Prospect BCAs. 
 

 *  Ensure automation is triggered after cutover to backfill BCAs and align with 1C prospect logic. 
 *  R1 scope: CRM logic change. 
 *  R2 scope: Validate synchronization with CLM/MDM once integrated.

867242,User Story,,,,,,Prevent “Closing (Won)” for Opportunities Linked to Customer Accounts in “Pending for Approval” Status (1C Districts Only),,," 
As a CRM Business User, I need the system to restrict users from closing opportunities as Won when the related Customer Sales Skill Account is in “Pending for Approval” status, so that opportunities tied to unapproved customer records cannot be finalized prematurely.

 
This rule should apply only to accounts belonging to One Customer (1C) districts. 
For non-1C districts, the behavior should remain unchanged, allowing opportunities to be closed regardless of the account’s approval status.
 

 
Once the customer account’s approval status transitions to Approved, users should then be allowed to close opportunities as Won following standard business rules.
 

 
Currently, there is no restriction on closing opportunities linked to customer accounts regardless of approval status. With the 1C implementation, an additional control is required to ensure the approval workflow is completed before revenue recognition or deal closure occurs.
 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Identify opportunities where the parent Account (Customer Sales Skill Account) belongs to a 1C district. 
 *  During the Close as Won operation (button click or stage change to “Won”): 

 *  The system must check the Approval Status of the related Account. 
 *  If the Approval Status = Pending for Approval, the system must block the Close as Won action. 
 *  The user should receive a clear message such as: 
 *  “This opportunity cannot be closed as Won because the associated customer account is still Pending for Approval.” 
 

 *  The Close as Lost operation must continue to be allowed. 
 *  If the Account’s Approval Status = Approved, users must be able to Close as Won without restriction. 
 *  For non-1C district accounts, no change in behavior — opportunities can be closed normally regardless of approval status. 
 *  The rule must apply consistently across: 

 *  The Close as Won button 
 *  The Opportunity Business Process Flow (BPF) when moving to the “Won” stage 
 *  Any automation or workflow that programmatically closes opportunities as Won.

 *  Scenario 1 – Search by Address 

 *  Given I am a Sales Rep or District Manager in CRM 

 *  When I search for an account by entering an address (full or partial) in the global search or quick find view 
 *  Then the system should return all matching sales skill account records that contain that address information 
 

 

 *  Scenario 2 – Search by Name 

 *  Given I am a Sales Rep or District Manager in CRM

 *  The CRM Quick Find View for Accounts must be enhanced to include the following searchable fields: 

 *  Account Name 
 *  Account Number (P-number, CLM number, ERP number) 
 *  Address (Street1, City, State, Postal Code — any of these should return results) 
 

 *  Search must return Sales Skill Account Records only (prospects or customers). 
 *  Search results must include records regardless of whether they are linked to a Prospect BCA or Customer BCA. 
 *  Users must be able to distinguish in the search results whether the returned record is: 

 *  A Sales Skill Account linked to a Prospect BCA, or 
 *  A Sales Skill Account linked to a Customer BCA. 
 

 *  No change in the current behavior for searching by name or number; only address-based search capability is net-new. 
 *  Search results should display account type (Prospect vs Customer) and Sales Skill clearly to aid user selection. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Update Account entity Quick Find View in CRM to add Address1: Line1, Address1: City, Address1: Postal Code, and other relevant address fields into the indexed search fields. 
 *  Ensure search indexing performance is tested — particularly for address fields, which may increase result size. 
 *  Security: Respect existing CRM security roles/record visibility rules. Search should only return records the user has access to. 
 *  Regression test: Ensure global search performance is not degraded, and existing filters on inactive accounts still work as designed.

846370,User Story,,,,,,Detect and Alert Users of Duplicate Prospects Across Sales Skills Before Save,,,"As a Sales Rep or District Manager,
I want CRM to automatically check for duplicates when I create a new prospect sales skill account,
 
So that I am alerted if a similar prospect already exists at the same location and can link to it instead of unintentionally creating a duplicate.
 

 

 

 
When reps create a new prospect account, CRM should check for duplicates (based on address and other details) and guide users to link to an existing record instead of creating a duplicate.
 
 
 
","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 

 *  Scenario 1 – Duplicate Prospect Detected 

 *  Given I enter prospect details (address, name, sales skill) and click Save for 1 C District 

 *  When CRM detects a matching prospect in the system (based on address + fuzzy match rules) 
 *  Then a pop-up message appears with two clear options: 

 *  Recommended Option (highlighted): “Existing prospect with similar details found for [XYZ] Sales Skill. [View Record] ? Use ‘Add New Sales Skill’ if needed.” 
 *  Secondary Option: “Proceed Anyway (Not Recommended).” 
 

 

 

 *  Scenario 2 – User Selects “View Record” 

 *  Given I select the “View Record” option from the duplicate detection pop-up 

 *  When the record opens 
 *  Then I am navigated to the existing prospect sales skill account form, where I can use the Add New Sales Skill button to continue. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 3 – User Selects “Proceed Anyway” 

 *  Given I select the “Proceed Anyway” option from the duplicate detection pop-up 

 *  When the record is saved 
 *  Then CRM creates a new prospect sales skill account without linking to the existing one. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 4 – No Duplicate Found 

 *  Given I enter prospect details and click Save 

 *  When no duplicate is found 
 *  Then no pop-up is shown, and the record is saved successfully as a new prospect. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 5 – Non-1C Districts 

 *  Given I enter prospect details and click Save 

 *  When I save the account 
 *  Then no pop-up is shown, and the record is saved successfully as a new prospect. 
 

 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Duplicate detection must trigger before save of a new prospect sales skill account. 
 *  Matching rules must include: 

 *  Address (primary, fuzzy match supported). 
 *  Name (exact or partial, depending on business rules). 
 

 *  Pop-up must always: 

 *  Show a recommended option to view and link to the existing record. 
 *  Provide a secondary option to proceed anyway, clearly marked as not recommended. 
 

 *  Messages must be short, crisp, and clear (business-friendly wording): 

 *  Recommended Option Label: “Similar prospect exists. [View Record] ? Use ‘Add New Sales Skill’ to continue.” 
 *  Secondary Option Label: “Proceed Anyway (Not Recommended).” 
 

 *  If the user chooses “View Record,” system must: 

 *  Open the existing sales skill account form. 
 *  Allow user to continue by clicking the Add New Sales Skill button. 
 

 *  If no duplicates exist, record saves without interruption. 
 *  Duplicate bypass (Proceed Anyway) must be logged for audit purposes. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Implement pre-save duplicate detection plugin/logic on the prospect sales skill entity. 
 *  Leverage fuzzy address matching + name . 
 *  Pop-up implementation: 

 *  Modal dialog with two action buttons (default highlight on “View Record”). 
 *  Labels and text must be configurable for easy business-driven updates. 
 

 *  “View Record” button must: 

 *  Open the matched record (form view). 
 *  Not create a new record during this action. 
 

 *  “Proceed Anyway” button must: 

 *  Complete the save and create a new record. 
 *  Write an entry to audit log with user, timestamp, record details, and “duplicate bypassed.” 
 

 *  If multiple duplicates are found, system should display the closest/highest match and allow the user to choose which one to view. 
 *  Ensure performance: duplicate check must not significantly delay save operations. 
 *  R1: Duplicate detection handled in CRM. 
 *  R2: Upgrade to CLM/MDM service-driven duplicate check (to replace or augment CRM logic).

846369,User Story,,,,,,Data Migration- Create a Prospect BCA and Update Sales Skill at Cutover,,,"As a Sales Operations Lead,
 
I want all in-scope prospect accounts at cutover to be automatically linked to a Prospect BCA and updated with the correct Sales Skill,
 
So that every prospect has a standardized structure (Prospect BCA + Sales Skill account) before go-live, enabling consistent future customer setup and avoiding duplicate handling issues.
 

 
Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Scenario 1 – Create Prospect BCA for Every In-Scope Prospect for 1C project 

 *  Given I have a finalized list of in-scope prospect accounts provided by the business 

 *  When the cutover process is executed 
 *  Then the system must automatically create a new Prospect BCA record for each prospect account (if one does not already exist) 
 

 

 *  Scenario 2 – Populate Sales Skill on Prospect Accounts 

 *  Given I have a prospect account included in the cutover scope 

 *  When the Prospect BCA is created 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field on that prospect must be populated as per business-provided mapping rules 
 

 

 *  Scenario 3 – Handle Multiple Prospects at the Same Address 

 *  Given there are two or more prospect accounts with the same address that the business has determined are not duplicates 

 *  When the cutover process runs 
 *  Then the system must ensure they are tied to the same Prospect BCA (not separate ones) 
 

 

 *  Scenario 4 – Exclude Out-of-Scope Prospects 

 *  Given a prospect account is not included in the business-provided cutover scope list 

 *  When the cutover process runs 
 *  Then no Prospect BCA should be created for it 
 

 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Business must provide a cleaned, finalized list of prospects in scope for cutover. 

 *  List must exclude duplicates and invalid records. 
 *  Business must define logic for grouping multiple prospects at the same address. 
 

 *  For each prospect in the list: 

 *  Create a Prospect BCA in CRM (if not already existing). 
 *  Use the prospect’s CRM-generated P-number as the BCA number. 
 *  Set ERP Status = Prospect on the new BCA. 
 *  Populate Sales Skill field on the prospect account based on business-defined mapping. 
 

 *  If multiple prospects are deemed non-duplicates at the same address: 

 *  Link them to the same Prospect BCA (do not create multiple BCAs). 
 

 *  Ensure the output structure at cutover is: 

 *  Prospect BCA ? one or more Prospect Sales Skill Accounts (prospects) 
 

 *  Exclude prospects not identified in scope. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Migration script required to: 

 *  Iterate through the provided list of prospect accounts. 
 *  Check if BCA already exists; if not, create a new Prospect BCA record. 
 *  Populate the BCA number with the P-number from the prospect. 
 *  Update ERP Status on the BCA = “Prospect.” 
 *  Update Sales Skill field on prospect accounts per mapping rules. 
 *  Handle grouping rules: if multiple prospects are mapped to the same BCA, ensure all are linked correctly. 
 *  Dependencies: 

 *  Business to provide finalized list of in-scope prospects and address grouping/duplicate-handling rules prior to execution. 
 

 

 

 *  Ensure migration is idempotent (rerun safe) — does not create duplicate BCAs if executed multiple times. 
 *  Validate migration with reconciliation reports (number of prospects in scope vs number of BCAs created). 
 *  Regression testing: confirm that non-scope prospects are untouched. 
 *  At cutover, automatically create a Prospect BCA for each prospect account and ensure the sales skill field is populated

 *  Given I am a Sales Ops user approving a prospect in CRM,

Business Requirements: 

 *  Every approved Prospect in a 1C district must have a BCA created and linked if one does not already exist. 
 *  BCA must inherit P-Number, Name, ERP Status, and Owner directly from the Prospect Account. 
 *  System must update the Prospect’s BCA Lookup with the new BCA automatically. 
 *  For non-1C Prospects, current CRM process remains unchanged (no auto BCA creation). 
 *  Ensures consistency in linking Sales Skill Accounts to BCAs and prevents manual errors in setup. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Confirm whether to leverage existing BCA creation plugin/logic or create a new workflow for this scenario. 
 *  Ensure logic checks if BCA Lookup is already populated; if yes, skip creation. 
 *  Create/update process should run synchronously on status change to Approved. 
 *  Update Prospect Account’s BCA Lookup field with the new BCA record’s GUID. 
 *  Ensure error handling if BCA creation fails (log entry + alert). 
 *  Security: Only users with appropriate Sales Ops/Admin roles should trigger the automation. 
 *  Unit test: Approving a Prospect ? New BCA is created, linked, and populated as expected.

 *  Given a user opens the Rejected Prospect view, 
 *  Then only records with Approval status = Rejected, District Has 1C flag and Status = Inactive should appear. 
 

 *  Merge Preparation  

 *  Given a rejected prospect is in the view,  
 *  When the Sales Ops user determines the correct active record,  
 *  Then they should activate the Rejected record first and 
 *  Then they should be able to use standard CRM Merge functionality manually to merge the rejected prospect into the active record.  
 

 *  Deactivation on Merge  

 *  Given a rejected prospect is merged into another account,  
 *  Then the rejected record should automatically be deactivated via out-of-the-box CRM behavior.  
 

 *  Re-Approval Flexibility  

 *  Given a rejected prospect was marked in error,  
 *  When a Sales Ops user updates its status back to Approved by activating the record and changing the Worked By 
 *  Then the standard approved prospect process (including BCA creation/linking) should apply.  
 

 *  Sorting 

 *  The view should be sorted from Newest to Oldest based on Created On 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  A 1C- Prospect Accounts Rejected system view must exist in CRM to surface all rejected prospects for Sales Ops review. 
 *  Sales Skill column must be included to help identify alignment. 
 *  The view should mimic “1C- Prospect Accounts Pending Approval” with only filter adjusted to pull Prospects with Approval Status = Rejected 
 *  Sales Ops should be able to update statuses manually (Rejected ? Approved) where appropriate. 
 *  Merging rejected prospects into active accounts will be a manual process using CRM’s native merge; this user story only ensures the visibility and setup for rejected records. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Create a new System View called “1C- Prospect Accounts Rejected ” 
 *  Filtering: Approval Status = Rejected, Status = Inactive and District is flagged as 1C 
 *  Columns: replicate “1C- Prospect Accounts Pending Approval” view 
 *  Confirm native merge functionality works seamlessly on records with Rejected status. 
 *  Regression test: Verify rejected records do not appear in Pending or Approved dashboards/views. 
 *  The view should be visible in the Ecolab Sales and Ecolab Admin MDA

 *  Sales Skill Defaulting 

 *  Given a Sales Skill account is cloned, 
 *  When the API executes, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field must be automatically set to the “other” skill (e.g., Water ? Hygiene or Hygiene ? Water), and the field must be locked. 
 

 *  Ownership Assignment 

 *  Given a new Sales Skill record is created, 
 *  When the record is saved, 
 *  Then the record must be assigned an owner. 
 *  Note: For testing purposes in this story, ownership will temporarily be assigned to a fixed test/system user (e.g., CRM Online or dummy DM). A future UI story will introduce dynamic primary owner selection and integrate with this API. 
 

 *  Record Linkage 

 *  Given a new Sales Skill record is created, 
 *  When the record is saved, 
 *  Then the record must be automatically linked to the same BCA as the source account. 
 

 

 

 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Support creation of Sales Skill accounts only for 1C districts. 
 *  Inherit field values from the source account as per mapping table. 
 *  Always default the Sales Skill field to the opposite skill and lock it. 
 *  Ensure ownership assignment follows the temporary fixed-user approach for this story. 
 *  Ensure non-1C districts cannot invoke this API. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Build a custom API/plugin that: 

 *  Accepts the Source Sales Skill Account ID. 
 *  Clones the record and links it to the same BCA. 
 *  Temporarily assigns ownership to a fixed test/system user (hardcoded or configurable). 
 

 *  This story validates cloning logic and field mapping. 
 *  Follow-up UI/Dialog story will: 

 *  Collect primary owner from the user, 
 *  Pass it to this API, 
 *  Replace fixed ownership assignment with dynamic selection. 
 

 *  Implement error handling and clear error messages. 
 *  Capture audit logs: source account, new account, assigned owner.

867240,User Story,,,,,,Automatically Set “Pending for Approval” Status for New Sales Skill Customer Records (1C Districts),,," 
As a CRM Functional User, when I create a new sales skill record under an existing customer using the Add Sales Skill button, the newly created record must automatically have its approval status set to “Pending for Approval.”
Even though the new account record is of Account Type = Customer, the Approval tab should remain visible and accessible on the account form to allow the review and approval process to proceed. 
This behavior must apply only to One Customer (1C) districts. 
For non-1C districts, the current logic remains unchanged:
 

 *  The Approval tab should remain hidden for Customer-type accounts. 
 *  The approval fields should not be auto-populated or editable. 
 

 
This change ensures that any new sales skill account created within 1C districts undergoes the same approval process as prospects, maintaining consistency and governance across divisions. 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  When a user clicks Add Sales Skill on an existing customer account within a 1C district, the system must: 

 *  Automatically set the Approval Status = Pending for Approval on the new record. 
 *  Ensure that the Approval tab is visible on the new account form. 
 *  Allow approvers or authorized roles to access and complete the approval workflow from the Approval tab. 
 

 *  For non-1C districts, the system must: 

 *  Maintain current behavior (Approval tab hidden, no approval status set). 
 *  Not apply any approval workflow logic for customer-type accounts created via Add Sales Skill. 
 

 *  The Account Type for the newly created record should remain Customer. 
 *  The logic must execute automatically as part of the Add Sales Skill creation process — no manual intervention required. 
 *  The “Pending for Approval” status must trigger the standard approval workflow already defined for the 1C approval process.

 *  When the new Customer (sales skill) record is created

 *  Given a newly created Customer record under a 1C district has Approval Status = Pending for Approval 

 *  When the account form is opened 
 *  Then the Approval tab must be visible and accessible, allowing approvers (Ops Amin) to complete the review process. 
 

 *  Given a user is in a non-1C district and adds a new sales skill under an existing Customer  

 *  When the new Customer record is created  
 *  Then the Approval tab must remain hidden, and no “Pending for Approval” status should be applied.

I want CRM to automatically create and link a Prospect BCA whenever I create a new Sales Skill Account (Account Type = Prospect),
 
So that all 1C prospect accounts are properly tied to a Prospect BCA and downstream CLM/MDM processes remain consistent.
 

 

 
When a new prospect account is created in CRM, the system should automatically generate a Prospect BCA record (with status = Prospect) and link it to that account.
 
","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Scenario 1 – New Prospect Created (1C Only) 

 *  Given I create a new Sales Skill Account (Account Type = Prospect) in a 1C District 

 *  When I save the record 
 *  Then CRM should automatically create a Prospect BCA and link it to the new account. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 2 – BCA Field Values 

 *  Given CRM creates a new Prospect BCA 

 *  When the record is created 
 *  Then it should inherit the following values from the linked Sales Skill Account: 

 *  Name = Sales Skill Account Name 
 *  Account Number = Sales Skill Account Number (P-number or inherited number if linked to an existing BCA) 
 *  ERP Status = Prospect 
 *  Owner = Owner of the Sales Skill Account (district-based ownership) 
 

 

 

 *  Scenario 3 – Automatic Linking 

 *  Given the Prospect BCA is created 

 *  When the account save completes 
 *  Then the new BCA must automatically populate in the BCA lookup field on the Sales Skill Account record. 
 

 

 *  Scenario 4 –  Non-1C Accounts 

 *  Given I create a Account  with District not flagged as 1C 

 *  When I save the record 
 *  Then CRM must not create a Prospect BCA. 
 

 *  This story applies only to 1C Districts and only for Prospect-type Sales Skill Accounts. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Automatically create and link a Prospect BCA whenever a new Prospect Sales Skill Account is created in a 1C District. 
 *  Prospect BCA creation must be automatic and require no manual input. 
 *  Field mapping for BCA creation: 

 *  Name ? inherit from Sales Skill Account Name 
 *  Account Number ? inherit from Sales Skill Account’s Account Number 
 *  ERP Status ? set to Prospect 
 *  Owner ? inherit from Sales Skill Account Owner 
 

 *  Ensure one-to-many relationship: Prospect BCA ? multiple Prospect Sales Skill Accounts. 
 *  For non-1C districts or non-prospect accounts, no change in behavior. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Extend account creation plugin/workflow logic: 

 *  On create of Sales Skill Account (Account Type = Prospect) AND District.Flag = 1C ? auto-create new BCA record if lookup empty. 
 *  Populate fields as per mapping. 
 *  Link Sales Skill Account back to BCA. 
 

 *  Ensure BCA number (Account Number) uses the same P-number logic as the account. 
 *  Restrict functionality explicitly to 1C Districts only.

858669,User Story,,,,,,Auto-Create BCA for Newly Created EBS Customer Accounts via the EBS ADF Pipeline (1C Districts),,,"As a CRM system, when a new customer account (type = Customer) is created in CRM via the EBS integration pipeline, and that account belongs to a district flagged as One Customer (1C), the system should automatically:
 

 *  Create a Base Customer Account (BCA) record if one does not already exist for the customer. 
 *  Populate the BCA with the same Name and Account Number as the new Sold-To/Customer account. 
 *  Set the ERP Account Status = Active. 
 *  Link the new Sales Skill account to the BCA and set the Sales Skill field appropriately (Water/Hygiene). 
 

 
If the account is already linked to an existing BCA (e.g., additional Water/Hygiene skill accounts created under the same customer), no new BCA should be created. The existing BCA should be retained, and the new Sales Skill account should be linked to that BCA. 

 
This ensures that all new EBS customer accounts created in CRM under 1C districts are always associated with a valid BCA.


Business Requirements: 

 *  Automatically create a BCA record for any new EBS customer (Sold-To) account created in CRM, when: 

 *  Account Type = Customer 
 *  District is flagged as One Customer (1C) 
 *  No existing BCA link is present 
 

 *  Populate the BCA with: 

 *  Name = Customer Account Name 
 *  Account Number = Customer Account Number (from EBS) 
 *  ERP Account Status = Active 
 

 *  Update the new account: 

 *  Set BCA Lookup to the newly created BCA (or existing one if found). 
 *  Set Sales Skill field based on the account’s global business (Water/Hygiene).

The BCA creation would happen through Sync plugin on Pre-operation stage of Account Create.
 

 
Problem - Bulk ingestion of Customer Accounts could run into a RACE condition where 2 Sales Skill accounts are processed parallelly in CRM and both trying to create a BCA record as it already doesn't exist. 

 
Solution - Leverage Alternate keys and use Upsert instead of Create 

 *  
 *  Define an Alternate Key on the Base Account entity using the Account Number. 
 *  This enforces uniqueness at the database level. 
 *  If two plugin executions try to create a Base Account with the same Account Number, one will fail due to the key constraint. Handle the exception in catch block. 

 *  The exception on create of second BCA request can be handled in catch block. Try to Retrieve the BCA record and associate the BCA with the Sales Skill Account.  
 


 
 
 

The use of Alternate Key will ensure we will not have duplicate records in BCA entity by any means (UI, or backend logic). 
 
Catch block will handle the error out record and do the association with BCA.

834666,Requirement,,,,,"11. Modernize Customer Setup UI to Include Sales Skill, ERP Source, and BCA Auto-Linking Logic",,,,"Business Capability Overview
 
As part of the One Customer initiative, the CRM customer setup process must evolve to reflect new foundational elements — Sales Skill, ERP System Source, and the Base Customer Account (BCA) relationship — which were not previously required in the legacy setup flow. The current customer setup interface does not accommodate these new dimensions and therefore requires modernization to ensure business users and system integrators can properly process new and converted customers under the One Customer model. 

 
The business expects that the modernized UI will:
 

 *  Surface and capture new mandatory fields (Sales Skill, ERP Source, BCA Number). 
 *  Auto-detect and link newly created customer accounts to the correct BCA when a match is found. 
 *  Support different flows based on whether the customer is net-new or part of an existing BCA family. 
 *  Guide CRM users (e.g., Sales Ops, District Coordinators) through a cleaner and more structured setup experience. 
 

 
This is essential to ensure the accuracy of downstream integration, user clarity, and to maintain data consistency across CRM, MDM, and EBS. 
Business Requirements 

 *  The Customer Setup UI must be updated to support: 

 *  Sales Skill selection (Water, Hygiene, etc.) as a required field (Inherited from the Prospect Account). 
 *  ERP Source (e.g., ECL_EBS, NALCO_SAP) either auto-detected or manually selected. 
 *  Base Customer Account Number — The MDM API's should return the BCA Number and indicate if the BCA is newly created in EBS or it already exists in EBS. 
 

 *  If a prospect account is being converted to a customer and MDM identifies that a BCA already exists for the same entity: 

 *  The UI must display or auto-link the record to that BCA. 
 

 *  Display warnings or prompts when a conflict is detected (e.g., same Sales Skill + ERP + account number already exists). 
 *  Use the One Customer flag configured at the district level to help system understand if enhanced setup flow is required. 
 *  Provide flexibility to handle both: 

 *  Net-new customers (no prior BCA linkage). 
 *  Sales Skill expansions (e.g., adding a Water record under an existing Hygiene customer). 
 

 *  Enforce any additional validation rules depending on the Sales Skill and ERP source selected. 
 *  Incorporate user role–based visibility where appropriate (e.g., hiding ERP source selection from general users, but showing it for admin roles). 
 *  If an existing Base Customer Account (BCA) is not found for the customer number returned from MDM during the customer conversion process, the system must automatically create a new BCA using the returned customer number. Once created, the system will immediately link the converted sales skill account to this new BCA without requiring manual user intervention. This ensures complete automation of BCA creation and linkage for One Customer–flagged districts.
 
 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Introduce or expose the following fields on the Customer Setup form:

834665,Requirement,,,,,10. Revamp Prospect Creation Experience to Support Sales Skill–Based Entry and Validation,,,,"Business Capability Overview
 
Under the One Customer model, prospect creation in CRM must evolve to a more structured and sales skill–driven experience. Today, prospects can be created with minimal validation and without a consistent approach to aligning them with specific sales skills (e.g., Water, Hygiene).  

 
In the future-state model, business users—particularly sales reps—must be able to create prospects that are explicitly tied to a sales skill (or sales division) at the time of creation. The system should enforce early validation rules to prevent duplication, ensure address quality, and correctly prepare records for integration with MDM and EBS.
 

 
The business expects this revamp to provide:
 

 *  A cleaner, more guided UI during prospect creation. 
 *  Clear designation of the intended sales skill. 
 *  Validation logic appropriate to One Customer–flagged districts. 
 *  Alignment with downstream setup and integration processes. 
 

 
Business Requirements 

 *  Allow users to select the Sales Skill (Water, Hygiene, etc.) at the time of prospect creation. 
 *  Automatically apply validations based on: 

 *  Selected District (including whether it is flagged for One Customer). 
 *  Sales Skill assignment. 
 *  Territory and division consistency rules. 
 

 *  For prospects in 1C-flagged districts, enforce: 

 *  Address validation rules (via MDM integration). 
 *  Duplicate check against existing CRM accounts and MDM. 
 *  Immediate MDM sync (covered separately in another requirement). 
 

 *  Business logic must drive user prompts or warnings if: 

 *  Sales skill is left blank. 
 *  An invalid combination of district and sales skill is chosen. 
 

 *  Ensure ability to enter prospects that are intended for new sales skill branches of existing customers (e.g., Water rep creating a Water prospect under a Hygiene customer). 
 *  Support UI elements such as: 

 *  Auto-population of related fields based on district selection. 
 *  Visual indicators of One Customer applicability. 
 *  Optional toggle to mark whether prospect should link to existing BCA (if known). 
 

 *  System should tag each prospect record appropriately to allow downstream teams to: 

 *  Route through the correct customer setup process. 
 *  Avoid setup bottlenecks due to missing or ambiguous sales skill alignment. 
 

 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Extend CRM Prospect form to include required and optionally recommended fields: 

 *  Sales Skill 
 *  Is 1C Flagged District 
 *  Intended Division 
 

 *  Modify form-level logic to: 

 *  Enable or disable specific fields based on territory selection. 
 *  Trigger validation on save or autosave events. 
 

 *  Update business rules or plugins to enforce validation: 

 *  Cross-check sales skill, division, and territory compatibility. 
 *  Prevent duplicate entries by comparing with existing prospects and accounts (CRM + MDM). 
 

 *  Ensure compatibility with downstream logic for: 

 *  MDM sync trigger. 
 *  Customer setup conversion flow. 
 

 *  UI/UX must be designed for clarity: 

 *  Distinct fields and tooltips for sales skill tagging. 
 *  Mandatory/optional field indicators. 
 *  Inline validation feedback messages. 
 

 *  Any legacy scripts, plugins, or forms used in prospect creation must be reviewed and either updated or deprecated. 
 *  A technical spike is not required at this stage but may be needed if issues arise during regression testing or UX compatibility reviews across different sales skill forms. 
 

 
Expected Deliverables 

 *  Updated Prospect creation form in CRM with required fields and validations. 
 *  Enhanced field validation logic (plugin or rule-based) for 1C district and sales skill tagging. 
 *  Tooltips, visual cues, and UI indicators supporting user guidance. 
 *  Documentation of business rules and validation logic. 
 *  Regression testing for prospect creation under different district and sales skill combinations. 
 *  Change management materials and updated user training assets.

869641,User Story,,,,Update TSR Form Quick View to Display “Sales Skill” Instead of “Global Business” for 1C Ac,,,,,"As a CRM user (Sales Rep, CAM, or Technical Resource),
I want to see the Sales Skill value displayed on the Account Quick View section of the TSR form instead of the Global Business field whenever the TSR is linked to a 1C-enabled account,
 
so that I can clearly identify whether the TSR belongs to Water or Hygiene and ensure I am viewing the correct division context aligned with the One Customer (1C) model.
 

 
Context and Background
Today, on the Technical Service Request (TSR) form, there is an Account Quick View Form that displays summary information from the linked Account record. 
This Quick View currently shows details such as Account Name, Number, and Global Business (e.g., Nalco Water, Food & Beverage, Life Sciences).
 

 
However, under the One Customer (1C) model:
 

 *  The Global Business field is being phased out for 1C accounts. 
 *  The Sales Skill field now represents the correct business classification (e.g., Water or Hygiene). 
 *  Future logic and form visibility will rely on Sales Skill rather than Global Business. 
 

 
To support this transition, the Quick View Form on TSR must be updated to show: 

 *  Sales Skill when the linked account is a 1C account (IsOneCustomer = Yes), 
 *  Global Business for all non-1C accounts to preserve backward compatibility. 
 

 
This change ensures users have an accurate and consistent business context on TSR records, supporting correct routing, reporting, and harmonization efforts in future releases. 

 
Functional and Technical Scope 

 *  Modify the Account Quick View form referenced on the TSR entity. 
 *  Introduce conditional display logic: 

 *  If IsOneCustomer = Yes, show Sales Skill; hide Global Business. 
 *  If IsOneCustomer = No, show Global Business; hide Sales Skill. 
 

 *  Ensure field labels and values render properly in Unified Interface (modern UI). 
 *  No changes to underlying Account entity logic — read-only display only. 
 *  Validate compatibility with existing scripts, forms, and embedded components.

 *  Server-side plugin (recommended for all channels) 
 *  Combination of both for best UX + enforcement. 
 

 

 *  Document pros/cons of each and recommend the final approach.

 *  Questions to answer 

 *  Best hook(s) to run cross-account check (client vs. server vs. hybrid) without regressions? 
 *  Data keys for match: confirm Name + Phone + Buying Role (case/whitespace/format normalization rules). 
 *  Result UX: unified warning modal with matched rows; feasibility for quick create & mobile. 
 *  “Use Existing Contact”: safest way to reference/associate the found contact (and any limits). 
 *  Security: ensure results respect row-level security; avoid leaking contact data. 
 

 

 
Options to Investigate
A. Server-side only 
Pre-operation plugin / sync workflow: blocks or injects warnings? (How to present a user choice?) 

 
B. Client-first + server fallback (hybrid)
 
Client (form onSave / quick create) calls custom action to search duplicates; show modal; pass user choice.
 
Server plugin re-validates on save for non-form channels (API/import). 

 
C. PCF for warning UX

857159,User Story,,,,Require Sales Skill Selection When Creating Opportunities on H5 Accounts (1C Only),,,,,"As a CAM,
I want the ability to select the Sales Skill when creating an opportunity on an H5 (Org) account linked to a 1C district,
 
So that opportunities are clearly distinguished as Water or Hygiene and downstream processes (reporting, forms, BPF logic) can behave consistently across the unified H5 structure.
 

 
This applies to:
 

 *  Quick Create Form – Sales Skill must be a visible, required dropdown before saving. 
 *  Full Opportunity Form – Sales Skill must appear in the Details section and reflect the chosen value (Water/Hygiene). 
 *  H5/Org Accounts linked to 1C districts only – Non-1C accounts remain unaffected. 
 

 
The Global Business field on H5 is being hidden and set to Food & Beverage by default in the backend. Therefore, the Sales Skill field on Opportunities becomes the key indicator for whether the opportunity is Water or Hygiene. 

","Yellapantula, Siva",New,Not In R1; NotNeeded,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,New,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Visibility Rule (1C vs Non-1C) 

 *  Given I open the Quick Create or full Opportunity form from an H5 account, 
 *  When the H5 is linked to at least one Sales Skill account in a district flagged as 1C = Yes, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field must appear and be required. 
 *  Given I open the same forms for an H5 not linked to any 1C Sales Skill accounts, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field should not appear (no change from today). 
 

 *  Quick Create Requirement 

 *  Given I open the Quick Create Opportunity form on a 1C-linked H5 account, 
 *  When I attempt to save without selecting a Sales Skill, 
 *  Then I should receive a validation error preventing save until a value is selected. 
 

 *  Full Opportunity Form Display 

 *  Given I create or open an Opportunity on a 1C-linked H5 account, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field must be visible in the Details section of the form and must display the selected value. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Add Sales Skill field to Quick Create Opportunity form for H5 accounts (1C only). 
 *  Make Sales Skill required before save on Quick Create. 
 *  Add Sales Skill to Details section of the full Opportunity form (1C only). 
 *  Enforce visibility rules: only show Sales Skill if H5 is linked to Sales Skill accounts in 1C districts. 
 *  Ensure Sales Skill values are written to the Opportunity record for downstream reporting and logic. 
 *  Non-1C H5/Org accounts: no changes; Sales Skill field not visible.

I want the system to warn me when attempting to remove a District ? SalesSkill mapping that has active Accounts linked,
 
so that I do not unintentionally break relationships or cause orphaned Accounts.
 
","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,Not In R1,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Given I am a System Admin or Ops Admin, 

 *  When I attempt to remove a SalesSkill mapping from a District, 
 *  Then the system checks for active Accounts linked to that District/SalesSkill. 
 

 *  Given active Accounts exist for that District/SalesSkill, 

 *  When I try to remove the mapping, 
 *  Then the system blocks the removal and provides a clear message: 
 *  “This District ? SalesSkill mapping cannot be removed because active Accounts are still associated. Please reassign or deactivate those Accounts before proceeding.” 
 

 *  Given no active Accounts exist, 

 *  When I remove the mapping, 
 *  Then the system allows the removal to proceed. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Prevent removal of District ? SalesSkill mappings if active Accounts are dependent on them. 
 *  Provide clear user messaging when blocking the removal. 
 *  Ensure validation applies only to active Accounts (inactive Accounts should not block removal). 
 *  Applies only to System Admins and Ops Admins, as they are the only roles who can perform this action. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  If custom intersect entity: 

 *  Add a pre-deactivate plugin to check for active Account associations before deactivation. 
 

 *  If native N:N relationship: 

 *  Implement a custom plugin/interceptor to prevent deletion if active Accounts exist. 
 

 *  Maintain audit log of blocked attempts and successful removals. 
 *  Consider including this as part of a broader data integrity validation framework for 1C.

Business Context: 
 
•Water Purity Solutions, which is a distinct part of the business focused on delivering water purification services and solution 
 
•WPS operates with its own customer base but also sells through existing business units such as Nalco Water and other Nalco divisions. 
 
•The WPS system is designed to: 
 
•Support water purification services across various business units. 
 
•Enable recurring service scheduling, particularly for tasks like DI bottle exchanges, which are common in WPS operations. 
 
•Integrate with CRM and SAP systems to manage service visits, billing arrangements, and technician assignments. 
 
•Auto-generate service visits every 30 days (instead of the standard 90 days) to accommodate the dynamic nature of WPS service cycles 1 
 
•This setup ensures that WPS can maintain high service standards while aligning with broader organizational processes and reporting structures. 
 
•The WBS (Water Purity Solutions) WPS services and processes are integrated across both Water and Hygiene teams, and the CRM setup reflects that shared usage. 
 
•The WPS process leverages the same service visit and recurring service framework as the broader Field Service organization 
 
Groups: Water & Hygiene 
Personas: 
 
•Sales Representatives: Initiate TSRs and VAS entries. 
 
•Technical Resource Managers: Approve TSRs and assign Subject Matter Experts. 
 
•Subject Matter Experts: Execute service visits. 
 
•Field Service Technicians: Handle service orders and recurring services. 
 
•Service Operations Team: Validate and manage service schedules and SAP work center mappings. 
 
•Product Owners: Oversee harmonization and integration efforts ( Christy Murray). 
 
•Leadership: Includes Corey DeMarco, who receives consolidated reporting across divisions 
 
Business Process Flow: 
 
1.TSR Creation: 
 
1.Sales Rep selects TSR group, type, application area, and enters issue/scope. 
 
2.Optional fields: Opportunity, TVD Program, Retain to Win. 
 
3.TSR is routed for approval (manager step varies by division). 
 
4.Technical Resource Manager assigns SME and approves travel. 
 
5.TSR is finalized with resolution method and risk assessment. 
 
2.VAS Creation: 
 
1.Created manually by Sales Rep or team member. 
 
2.Automatically generated for Life Sciences via TSR. 
 
3.Created from service activity (district visits). 
 
4.Bulk uploaded quarterly for lab analysis. 
 
3.Recurring Services: 
 
1.Sales Rep sets up preventive maintenance plans. 
 
2.Includes ship-to selection, technology platform, service type, assets, billing arrangement. 
 
3.Auto-generates service visits based on schedule. 
 
4.Service Orders: 
 
1.Validated by operations team. 
 
2.Includes SAP work center, labor codes, and order types. 
 
3.Data sent to SAP for execution. 
 
Downstream Systems/Integration:
•SAP/EBS Integration: 
 
•Work centers, billing arrangements, and service types must align with EBS codes. 
 
•Mapping required between current SAP and future EBS work centers . 
 
•Reporting Consistency: 
 
•Harmonized fields across divisions ensure unified reporting for managers. 
 
•Field Visibility: 
 
•Global Business and Sales Skill fields drive form behavior and required inputs. 
 
•Data Conversion: 
 
•Existing open service orders must be updated with new EBS work center 
 
Impact Considerations:
•CRM Account form fields SAP Division & SAP Distribution Channels. Integration of these fields to SAP & EBS. 
 
•Global Business vs. Sales Skill: 
 
•Drives visibility and requirement of fields like Pack Code and Cost Center. 
 
•Future state will hide Global Business and use Sales Skill instead. 
 
•Ship-To Selection: 
 
•Determines service location; future state aims for alignment with Sold-To. 
 
•Account Merging: 
 
•Impacts group setup and form behavior; harmonization needed to avoid dual screens

","Yellapantula, Siva",New,Nice to Have; Not In R1; NotNeeded,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,New,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria: 

 *  Scope (1C only) 

 *  Given an account belongs to a 1C district 
 *  When District or Sales Skill is created/updated 
 *  Then the system must validate the District–Sales Skill combination. 
 *  Given an account belongs to a non-1C district 
 *  When District or Sales Skill is created/updated 
 *  Then behavior remains unchanged (no new validation). 
 

 *  Real-time filtering (UX) 

 *  Given I select or change the District on a 1C account in the UI 
 *  When I open the Sales Skill dropdown 
 *  Then only Sales Skills valid for that District are shown. 
 

 *  District change clears incompatible Sales Skill 

 *  Given a 1C account has Sales Skill A and I change District to one where A is invalid 
 *  When the form recalculates 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field is cleared and enabled for a new valid selection. 
 

 *  Save-time server validation — UI 

 *  Given I edit a 1C account in the UI 
 *  When I attempt to save a District–Sales Skill combination that is not valid 
 *  Then the save is blocked and I see: 

 *  “Selected Sales Skill is not valid for the chosen District. Please select a valid Sales Skill.” 
 

 

 *  Save-time server validation — Data Import 

 *  Given I import accounts that include 1C records 
 *  When a row contains an invalid District–Sales Skill pair 
 *  Then that row fails with the same validation error; other valid rows proceed. 
 

 *  Mapping changes over time 

 *  Given Ops Admin update the District?Sales Skill allowed list 
 *  When a user later saves a 1C account with an out-of-date combination 
 *  Then the save is blocked until a valid Sales Skill is selected. 
 

 *  Valid path — no prompts 

 *  Given a 1C account has a valid District–Sales Skill combination 
 *  When I save 
 *  Then the record saves without warnings. 
 

 

Business Requirements:

 *  Apply District–Sales Skill validation to 1C accounts only; do not change behavior for non-1C accounts. 
 *  Provide real-time filtering in the UI so users only see valid Sales Skills for the selected District. 
 *  Automatically clear Sales Skill when District changes to one where the current Sales Skill is invalid. 
 *  Enforce a server-side validation rule at save time across all channels (UI, imports, API/SDK, integrations, offline sync). 
 *  Use a clear, business-friendly error message (see BAC) and keep messaging consistent across channels. 
 *  Support mapping changes over time; previously saved invalid combos must be corrected before the next successful save. 
 *  No additional prompts when combinations are valid; keep UX simple and consistent.

Today, account currency defaults incorrectly based on the creating user’s personal settings or integration behavior, resulting in inconsistent values (e.g., unintended USD).

","Yellapantula, Siva",New,Refine,\FBU 1C\CRM,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,New,Business,2,"Business Acceptance Criteria: 

 *  Default Currency Maintained at Country Level 

 *  Given the Country table includes a “Default Currency” field 
 *  When a user views any Country record 
 *  Then the Default Currency field must be visible on the Country record 
 *  And the field must display a valid default currency value for that country 
 *  And Finance (or designated business owners) must be able to review and validate that the currency assigned to each country is correct prior to cutover. 
 

 *  Account Currency Must Always Derive from Country Default Currency 

 *  Given a new account is being created (prospect, customer, or sales-skill account) 
 *  When the user or system sets the country for that account 
 *  Then the account currency must automatically populate from the Country’s default currency value 
 *  And must not depend on the user’s personal settings 
 

 *  Applies to All Account Creation Channels 

 *  Given an account is created via any channel 

 *  CRM UI

","Yellapantula, Siva",Removed,Hold; Not In R1,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,1,"Business Acceptance Criteria: 

 *  Uniqueness Enforcement 

 *  Given I am reviewing BCAs in CRM, when I search by Base Customer Account Number, then only one record exists for each number. 
 

 *  Integration Sync 

 *  Given the integration sends a payload with a Base Customer Account Number that already exists in CRM, when the record is processed, then the existing BCA is updated and no duplicate is created. 
 

 *  UI Restrictions

 *  Integration from MDM must always use the BCA number provided by MDM; duplicates cannot be created. 
 *  If a BCA already exists with the same BCA number, the integration must update the existing record, not create a new one. 
 *  Business users (DM, CAM, AM, Sales Rep) must not be able to create or edit the BCA number through the CRM UI. 
 *  Users must be able to see the BCA number alongside Customer Name in default views so they can confirm uniqueness.

 *  Uniqueness Scope 

 *  The Base Customer Account Number is the system-wide unique identifier for BCA. 
 *  Payloads from MDM must use this number; any record with the same number should map to the same BCA (no new record is created). 
 *  There is exactly one BCA per Base Customer Account Number in CRM. 
 

 *  Normalization Before Matching 

 *  Before duplicate check, the Base Customer Account Number is normalized by: 

 *  Removing leading/trailing spaces. 
 

 *  Duplicate check uses the normalized value. 
 

 

 *  UI Behavior for Business Users 

 *  Business users cannot create BCAs from the UI. 
 *  Business users cannot edit the Base Customer Account Number. 
 *  Any attempt to change the number in the UI is blocked by permissions. 
 

 *  Views & Validation 

 *  Default BCA views display Customer Name and Base Customer Account Number so users can verify uniqueness.

861880,User Story,,,,Implement CAM/GAM support in existing EBS Integration (D365-Snowflake-D),,,,,"As a data engineer working on the Ecolab Snowflake Integrations project, I want to add support for CAM (Customer Account Manager) and GAM (Global Account Manager) roles in the ADF pipelines and dataflows, including CRM data cleanup and collaboration with the MAP 2.0 team to identify assignments and views, so that these roles are accurately mapped and integrated into account alignments.The new requirement for CAM/GAM support involves enhancing ADF to handle these managerial roles in account alignments. This includes performing data cleanup on the CRM side to ensure data quality, working with the MAP 2.0 team to locate and use the correct Snowflake view for assignments, and updating pipelines/dataflows with necessary modifications. Focus on minimal changes, leveraging existing sources where possible, and ensuring scalability for the Food and Beverage ""One Customer"" initiative.From other story:As a data engineer working on the Ecolab Snowflake Integrations project, I want to support Organizational Accounts (also known as H5 accounts) in the ADF pipelines and dataflows, so that these account types are properly handled in the EBS and MAP 2.0 integrations without data loss or misalignment.Organizational Accounts (H5) represent a specific account type in Ecolab's hierarchy, requiring dedicated handling in ADF to ensure they are included in sold-to alignments and CRM updates. This involves updating sources, joins, and sinks in relevant pipelines/dataflows, with potential new lookups for H5-specific attributes.

 *  Given I am a DM or CAM 

 *  When I search using a BCA number or name in Global Search, Then the system must return the relevant BCA record in the results. 
 

 *  Given the search results include BCA records 

 *  When they are displayed, Then the results must show BCA Name and BCA Number fields for clear identification. 
 

 *  Given Global Search is enabled for BCA 

 *  When other entities (like Accounts, Contacts) are also searched, Then performance and filtering must remain consistent across all entities. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements:

 *  Enable Base Customer Account (BCA) as a searchable entity in Global Search. 
 *  Ensure BCA Name and BCA Number are the default fields displayed in the results grid. 
 *  Maintain Global Search performance standards when querying across entities. 
 *  Navigation from results should link directly to the selected BCA record.

839756,User Story,,,,Enable 1C Section on District Form with Sales Skill Association Grid,,,,," 
As a CRM Ops Admins or a System Admin user, I want the District record form to display a dedicated “1C” section (on the General tab) when the One Customer (1C) flag = Yes, so that I can manage required Sales Skill associations for 1C districts.
This ensures that every district marked as 1C has at least one active Sales Skill linked, prevents invalid deactivations, and enforces governance around global business values.

 
","Chopra, Ashish",Removed,Hold; Not In R1,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,Removed from the backlog,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria: 

 *  Enable 1C Section 

 *  Given a District record exists, 
 *  When the 1C flag is set to Yes, 
 *  Then the 1C section and Sales Skill subgrid are displayed on the form. 
 

 *  Require at Least One Sales Skill 

 *  Given a District record is being updated, 
 *  When a user sets 1C = Yes, without linking at least one active Sales Skill, 
 *  Then the system prevents save and shows error: 

 *  “At least one active Sales Skill must be associated before enabling One Customer.” 
 

 

 *  Hide New, Deactivate and Activate button on the Sales Skill Subgrid 

 *  Active and Deactivate button should not be enabled on the Sale Skill Subgrid
 
 *  Users should not be able to create a new Sales Skill from this Subgrid 
 

 *  Global Business Lock 

 *  Given a District has Global Business populated, 
 *  When 1C = Yes, 
 *  Then Global Business is hidden and locked but its existing value remains stored. 
 

 *  1C Update (Yes ? No) 

 *  Given a District has 1C = Yes with Sales Skills linked, 
 *  When the user sets 1C = No, 
 *  Then Global Business becomes visible and editable again, while existing Sales Skill associations remain. 
 

 *  Prevent Removing Last Sales Skill 

 *  Given a District with 1C = Yes has one active Sales Skill linked, 
 *  When a user attempts to remove or deactivate that last Sales Skill, 
 *  Then the system blocks the action and shows error: 

 *  “At least one active Sales Skill must remain linked while One Customer is enabled.” 
 

 

 *  Tool Tip Messaging 

 *  Tooltip on Sales Skill subgrid explains: 

 *  “Districts flagged as One Customer must always have at least one active Sales Skill linked.” 
 

 

 *  Security & Audit 

 *  Only authorized users (Ops Admin Lead, System Admin) can update 1C flag and manage Sales Skill associations. 
 *  All changes to 1C flag, Global Business, and Sales Skill links are audited with timestamp and user ID. 
 

 

Business Requirements: 

 *  Add a “1C” section on the District form, located under the General tab. 
 *  The section should contain: 

 *  1C Flag (already implemented separately; not in scope here). 
 *  Sales Skill subgrid to display/manage linked Sales Skills. 
 

 *  Behavior when 1C Flag = Yes: 

 *  Subgrid becomes visible and editable. 
 *  At least one active Sales Skill must always remain linked. 
 *  If a user attempts to set 1C = Yes without linking a Sales Skill ? system prevents save. 
 

 *  Global Business field: 

 *  Remains populated with existing value but becomes hidden and locked. 
 

 *  Behavior when 1C Flag is updated from Yes ? No: 
 *  Global Business field becomes visible and editable again. 
 *  Sales Skill subgrid remains visible (if associations exist). 
 *  Associations are not deleted but no longer enforce restrictions. 
 *  Validation: 

 *  Cannot remove or deactivate the last active Sales Skill when 1C = Yes. 
 *  Deactivation/removal allowed for other Sales Skills if ?1 active remains. 
 

 *  Security: 

 *  Only Ops Admins and System Admins can change the 1C flag and manage associations. 
 

 

 
Developer Notes:

 *  Subgrid should be conditionally visible only when 1C = Yes. 
 *  Coding needed for the Add Existing Sales Skill Button for Ops Admin Leads 
 *  Save logic must enforce “at least one active Sales Skill” rule for both UI and API calls. 
 *  Lock/hide Global Business when 1C = Yes, restore visibility/edit when 1C = No. 
 *  Ensure auditing is enabled on 1C flag, Global Business, and Sales Skill link entity. 
 *  Error handling must be consistent across UI and API (prevent invalid updates from integrations).

844820,User Story,,,,Detect and Warn Users of Duplicate Contacts Across Existing Customer Account Records Linked to the Same BCA,,,,,"As a CRM user, I need the system to detect potential duplicate contacts not only within the same account but also across all accounts linked to the same Base Customer Account (BCA), so that I am alerted when I am about to create a duplicate and can either reuse the existing contact or proceed knowingly.
 

 
Current State: 
Today, CRM’s duplicate detection rule for Contacts functions at the individual account level:

 *  If a user creates a contact named ABC with phone number 123 and buying role XYZ under a customer account, CRM’s duplicate detection rule will trigger if the same Name + Phone Number + Buying Role is attempted again within that same account. 
 *  This works correctly and must remain unchanged. 
 

 
Future State (1C Model): 
With the One Customer (1C) model, multiple Existing Customer Account Records (Sales Skill Accounts) may be linked to the same Base Customer Account (BCA). Example:
 

 *  Contact ABC, phone 123, buying role XYZ exists under the Water account. 
 *  A user then attempts to create the same contact under the Hygiene account, also linked to the same BCA. 
 *  The current duplicate detection will not catch this, because the rule only works at the single-account level. 
 

 
Business Need: 
We need to preserve existing duplicate detection logic (single-account check) AND extend it by adding a BCA-level duplicate detection rule.
 

 
When creating or editing a contact under an account linked to a BCA, CRM should: 

 *  Run existing duplicate detection for the same account (unchanged). 
 *  Run an additional duplicate check across all accounts linked to the same BCA. 
 *  If a match is found in another account under the same BCA: 

 *  Display a warning message before save completes. 
 *  Show a list of matched contacts with key details (Name, Email, Phone, Buying Role, Contact Owner, Account Owner). 
 *  Provide two options: 

 *  Use Existing Contact ? reference the existing record to avoid duplication. 
 *  Create Anyway ? allow creation but alert the user. 
 

 

 

 
 
","Yellapantula, Siva",New,Not In R1; NotNeeded,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,New,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Given I am a user creating or editing a contact under an Existing Customer Account Record linked to a BCA, 

 *  When the system detects a duplicate under the same account, 
 *  Then the current duplicate detection rule should still fire as it does today. 
 

 *  Given I am creating or editing a contact under an account linked to a BCA, 

 *  When a duplicate (same Name + Phone Number + Buying Role) exists under another account linked to the same BCA, 
 *  Then I should see a warning message before save completes. 
 *  And the message should list matched contacts with details (Name, Email, Phone Number, Buying Role, Contact Owner, Account Owner). 
 *  And I should have two clear options: 

 *  Use Existing Contact ? auto-link/reference the existing record. 
 *  Create Anyway ? continue with new contact creation. 
 

 *  And this extended detection should apply only across accounts linked under the same BCA, not to unrelated customer accounts. 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Maintain current duplicate detection logic (same account, same contact). 
 *  Add an extended duplicate detection rule across accounts linked under the same BCA. 
 *  Ensure that both rules work together without conflict. 
 *  Provide a warning message before save completes when a duplicate is found across the same BCA. 
 *  Display matched contact details: Name, Email, Phone, Buying Role, Contact Owner, Account Owner. 
 *  Provide two options: 

 *  Use Existing Contact (reference) 
 *  Create Anyway (bypass). 
 

 *  Do not trigger the extended duplicate detection for unrelated customer accounts. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Do not remove or modify the existing CRM duplicate detection rules; they must remain functional. 
 *  Implement a new custom duplicate detection check scoped to BCA-linked accounts. 
 *  The new check must trigger in addition to the standard CRM duplicate detection, not instead of it. 
 *  Query logic must: 

 *  Identify the current account’s linked BCA. 
 *  Check all other accounts linked to that BCA. 
 *  Compare Name + Phone Number + Buying Role against existing contacts. 
 

 *  Warning message must dynamically display matched contacts. 
 *  Ensure “Use Existing Contact” creates a reference link instead of duplication. 
 *  “Create Anyway” should allow the save but log the event. 
 *  Must handle performance efficiently for BCAs linked to multiple accounts. 
 *  Regression testing: confirm current detection still works at single-account level and that new rule does not over-trigger for unrelated accounts.

864702,User Story,,,,DC: Clone Water SHIP-TO to Create Hygiene SHIP-TO for Common BCA Customers,,,,,"As a data conversion analyst,
 
I want to automatically create a Hygiene SHIP-TO by cloning the existing Water SHIP-TO under the same Base Customer Account (BCA),
 
so that both Hygiene and Water SOLD-TOs have corresponding SHIP-TO records for consistent downstream integration and reporting.
 

 
Background and Rationale 
Under the One Customer model, every customer (BCA) can have up to two SOLD-TO accounts — one for Water (legacy NSAP) and one for Hygiene (EBS). 
In some cases:
 

 *  Both Water and Hygiene SOLD-TOs exist for the same BCA. 
 *  Water SOLD-TO has one or more SHIP-TOs, but Hygiene SOLD-TO has none (since Hygiene previously didn’t use SHIP-TOs). 
 

 
To maintain parity across divisions and enable consistent data flow to integrated systems, each Hygiene SOLD-TO must have at least one SHIP-TO. 
If a Water SHIP-TO already exists for the same customer: 

 *  The data conversion package must clone the Water SHIP-TO and link it to the Hygiene SOLD-TO, copying key attributes and updating the Sales Skill to “Hygiene.” 
 

 
The sequencing of related activities must be as follows: 

 *  Update Account Number, Sales Skill and Reparent the Sold To's on the  SHIP-TOs that are promoted to SOLD-TOs (already covered in another SHIP-TO story). 
 *  SHIP-TO merges where multiple Water SHIP-TOs are linked to Sold To's are reduced to one per Water SOLD-TO. 
 *  Update of SHIP-TO number and Sales Skill where applicable.
 
 *  Execution of this cloning logic to create Hygiene SHIP-TOs.

 *  Scenario 1 – Identify Eligible Accounts for Cloning 

 *  Given a customer (BCA) has both a Water SOLD-TO (legacy NSAP) and a Hygiene SOLD-TO (EBS), 
 *  And the Water SOLD-TO has exactly one active SHIP-TO after all merges are complete, 
 *  And the Hygiene SOLD-TO currently has no SHIP-TO, 
 *  When the cloning process runs, 
 *  Then a new Hygiene SHIP-TO record is created under the Hygiene SOLD-TO. 
 

 *  Scenario 2 – Clone Water SHIP-TO Attributes 

 *  Given the Water SHIP-TO record exists in CRM, 
 *  When the cloning script executes, 
 *  Then it duplicates all core attributes including Name, Address, City, Country, Zip/Postal Code, and Account Number, 
 *  And assigns the Sales Skill = “Hygiene” on the cloned record. 
 *  And establishes the Parent Account relationship with the Hygiene SOLD-TO.

Business context
In 1C alignment, multiple legacy accounts (e.g., Water variants or Hygiene variants) may be merged into a single account under the same BCA. 
If those source accounts contain contacts with the same Name + Email + Phone + Buying Role, they are potential duplicates and must be surfaced and addressed during data conversion (not via CRM UI logic).
 

 
","Yellapantula, Siva",New,Not In R1; NotNeeded,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,New,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria:

 *  Given a planned merge of multiple Hygiene or Water accounts into a single account before linking it under the same BCA, 

 *  When the data conversion job runs in analysis/dry-run mode, 
 *  Then it produces a Duplicate Contacts Report listing candidate duplicates using Name + Email + Phone + Buying Role as the match keys, grouped by BCA and target account. 
 

 *  Given the Duplicate Contacts Report is generated, 

 *  When duplicates are confirmed by the data team, 
 *  Then the conversion provides a guided resolution output (per group) indicating which contact becomes master and which become to-link / to-skip, without creating duplicate rows. 
 

 *  Given the conversion runs in execute mode, 

 *  When duplicate groups have a selected resolution, 
 *  Then the conversion prevents creation of duplicate contact rows and retains one master per duplicate set, applying the chosen action for the rest (e.g., skip create, reference/link where applicable). 
 

 *  Given contacts in different BCAs share the same identity information, 

 *  When the conversion evaluates duplicates, 
 *  Then it does not flag cross-BCA matches (scope is within the same BCA only). 
 

 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  Detect potential duplicate Contacts within the same BCA across source accounts being merged into a single target account. 
 *  Use Name + Email + Phone + Buying Role as the matching keys (normalized for whitespace/case/format). 
 *  Produce a dry-run report for business review: BCA, target account, contact identity fields, source account(s), and recommended master. 
 *  Support a guided resolution: master selection + action for non-masters (skip/create-link/reference as applicable). 
 *  Execute mode must prevent duplicate contact creation and preserve only the designated master per set. 
 *  Apply the same protocol during initial migration and any re-loads. 
 *  Exclude cross-BCA matches from duplicate grouping. 
 

 
Developer Notes: 

 *  Normalization: trim/case-insensitive for Name; standardize Phone (e.g., E.164); exact match on Buying Role; Email lowercased. 
 *  Matching logic: primary key = (Name, Email, Phone, Buying Role). If Email or Phone is missing, still include record but only match when all four fields are present (avoid over-merge). 
 *  Reports: 

 *  Duplicate Contacts Report (dry-run): BCA, target account, source account(s), contact IDs (legacy + CRM), identity fields, suggested master, group ID. 
 *  Resolution Input Template: CSV/XLSX for business to mark master/non-master actions. 
 *  Execution Log: actions taken per contact, skipped/retained counts. 
 

 *  Actions in execute mode: 

 *  Master: create/update one contact. 
 *  Non-masters: skip create; where feasible, store a reference/map to the master (for traceability). 
 

 *  Scope constraints: only contacts within the same BCA; ignore cross-BCA similarities. 
 *  Outputs to deliver: duplicate report, resolution template, execution log, and a summary dashboard (counts by BCA: analyzed, flagged, resolved).

834307,Feature,,,,CRM: Contact De-duplication and Alignment for BCA Model,,,,," 
With the introduction of the Base Customer Account (BCA) model in CRM, contact management practices must evolve to support a shared enterprise view while preserving operational clarity at the sales skill account level. This feature enables structured alignment, de-duplication, and regression validation of contact records across Water and Hygiene sales skills under a single BCA umbrella.

 
Under the new model:
 

 *  Contacts will be created and owned only at the Sales Skill Account level (i.e., Water or Hygiene-specific account), not at the BCA level. 
 *  BCAs will display read-only views of all associated contacts for enterprise visibility, enabling downstream systems and users to see a full contact picture without modifying ownership. 
 *  This approach helps simplify governance, reduce conflicts over ownership, and maintain clear accountability for updates. 
 

 
However, this model introduces potential for duplicate contact creation across Sales Skill Accounts under the same BCA. For example, if a contact is created on both Water and Hygiene accounts under the same BCA, the system may not detect it using standard CRM deduplication logic, which only flags duplicates within the same account. Therefore, new duplicate detection logic must be introduced to detect and warn users of potential duplicate contacts across linked sales skill accounts under a common BCA, based on a defined match rule (e.g., Name + Email + Phone). 

 
Additionally, account merge scenarios must be carefully handled to avoid contact duplication:
 

 *  In scenarios where multiple Water or Hygiene accounts are merged under the same BCA (e.g., during data cleanup or FBU migration), contact lists must be consolidated and deduplicated prior to or during the merge. 
 *  Standard CRM merge logic may simply concatenate contact lists from both accounts (e.g., 5 + 4 = 9), potentially creating duplicate entries. Thus, deduplication and validation tools or custom pre-merge routines must be explored. 
 

 
This feature also includes a technical spike to evaluate and potentially design new deduplication UI behavior, merge conflict resolution experience, and contact match rule configuration. The output of this spike will determine whether configuration, plugin-based logic, or custom UI components are needed. 

 
Finally, regression testing must be conducted to ensure that all existing integrations using contact data remain valid post-BCA model rollout. These include integrations with:
 

 *  Ecolab 3D 
 *  Ecolab.com 
 *  Connect 
 *  CDM (Customer Data Management) 
 *  Other downstream platforms consuming contact information via APIs

834674,Requirement,,,,,Restrict Adding New Contacts from the BCA – Ensure Contact Creation Only from Existing Customer Account Records,,,,"Business Objective:
 
Ensure clean governance and prevent ownership conflicts by clearly defining where contacts can be created or edited. As part of the One Customer model, contacts should no longer be managed directly at the Base Customer Account (BCA) level. Instead, contact records must be exclusively created, edited, and managed at the Sales Skill Account level (Water or Hygiene), aligning with how relationship ownership, communication, and activities are tracked in field operations. 

 
Business Requirement: 

 *  Users must only be permitted to create new contact records under Sales Skill Accounts (CRM Account Type = Sales Skill). 
 *  The “Add New Contact” and “Edit Contact” options should be disabled on the BCA form (CRM Account Type = Base Customer). 
 *  All ownership, lookup values, and activities related to a contact should remain associated with the Sales Skill Account under which it was created. 
 *  The Base Customer Account (BCA) form should display a consolidated, read-only list of associated contacts from all linked Sales Skill Accounts (Water and Hygiene) for enterprise visibility. 
 *  The contact subgrid on the BCA form must be non-editable and clearly labeled as “View Only – Contact Details from Sales Skill Accounts.” 
 *  The subgrid must support basic sorting and filtering (e.g., by name, email, phone), but no inline editing, create, or delete options should be available. 
 *  Show the Sales Skill on each contact row to indicate contact ownership. 
 *  No workflows, forms, or Power Automate logic should inadvertently allow contact creation or updates directly on a BCA record. 
 

Additional Note (for Regression Validation – Contact Touchpoints):
As part of this requirement, the following integration touchpoints must be validated via regression testing to ensure they continue to behave correctly with the One Customer BCA model in place: 

 *  Contact creation and updates must continue to sync correctly to: 

 *  Ecolab 3D 
 *  Connect Portal 
 *  CDM 
 *  Ecolab.com user management 
 

 *  Ensure that contact record changes from CRM: 

 *  Trigger CDM updates appropriately. 
 *  Reflect accurately in external portals and systems tied to that sales skill account. 
 *  Respect the read-only nature of contacts at the BCA level, and ensure external systems are not affected by this constraint. 
 

 *  Validate that no impact is introduced to: 

 *  Role assignment 
 *  Contact-to-user mapping in portals 
 *  Customer communication workflows 
 

 *  Conduct thorough regression scenarios covering common contact creation, editing, syncing, and external visibility actions. 
 *  No new development is expected from this validation; any issues identified during regression need to be separately triaged. 
 

 
 
 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  Update form-level security or JavaScript rules to disable new/edit options on the Contact subgrid within the BCA form. 
 *  Ensure the ribbon button logic (e.g., “+ New Contact” or “Edit”) respects the Account Type context and is hidden or disabled on the BCA. 
 *  Validate that quick create forms, command bar actions, and related entity forms (e.g., Contact > Parent Account lookup) enforce this restriction. 
 *  Test across CRM interfaces: Web, Mobile, and Hub Portal (if applicable). 
 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Updated Account form logic to restrict contact creation/editing on BCA records. 
 *  Script or ribbon customization to disable or hide add/edit contact buttons for BCA type. 
 *  Regression testing documentation ensuring no paths exist (form, automation, integration) to modify contact data under BCA. 
 *  Sign-off from business stakeholders confirming compliance with contact governance policy.

To maintain clean and consistent contact data across Sales Skill Accounts during Base Customer Account (BCA) consolidation efforts. This includes both manual account merges in CRM and automated account merges during data conversion. The goal is to prevent contact duplication, reduce user confusion, and preserve accurate contact history when multiple Sales Skill Accounts belonging to the same BCA are merged. 

 
Business Requirements : 

 *  When multiple accounts (e.g., multiple Hygiene or Water accounts) are merged into a single Sales Skill Account as part of BCA alignment, CRM must ensure that duplicate contacts are not unintentionally carried forward. 
 *  During such merges: 

 *  Contact records with matching Name, Email, and/or Phone should be identified as potential duplicates. 
 *  The merge process should include automated or guided deduplication to avoid retaining multiple copies of the same contact. 
 

 *  If two merged accounts have contacts with overlapping identity information: 

 *  CRM must flag these for review and prompt the user or admin to retain only one primary contact record, merging associated data where possible. 
 

 *  This same process must also be supported during data conversion/migration activities (e.g., from legacy systems into CRM during One Customer rollout). 
 

 
Technical Considerations: 

 *  A technical spike is required to: 
 *  Analyze CRM’s native merge behavior for Accounts and Contacts and assess whether additional logic is needed to support pre-merge deduplication. 
 *  Determine whether CRM’s existing duplicate detection rules can be used in bulk merges or data import jobs. 
 *  Identify required logic to: 

 *  Prevent duplicates from being brought in during initial data loads. 
 *  Support interactive de-duplication workflows during manual merges initiated by business users. 
 

 *  Evaluate performance and UI limitations in scenarios where merged accounts have dozens or hundreds of contacts. 
 *  Merge logic must support: 

 *  Contact identity matching using Email, Phone, Full Name, and other optional keys (e.g., External Contact ID). 
 *  Preservation of contact history (e.g., Notes, Appointments, Opportunity involvement) when duplicates are merged. 
 

 *  Clear handling of edge cases such as: 

 *  Partial matches (e.g., same name but different email) 
 *  Soft duplicates (e.g., slightly varied names or phone numbers) 
 *  Cross-division records with conflicting ownership 
 

 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Documented pre-merge deduplication rules and logic for Contacts. 
 *  Scripts, tools, or logic embedded in CRM merge process and data conversion jobs to detect and flag duplicates. 
 *  Updated data migration documentation and playbooks reflecting contact deduplication steps. 
 *  Test cases to validate: 

 *  Deduplication accuracy 
 *  Post-merge data integrity (no missing links) 
 *  Regression impacts on contact-related functionality (e.g., Activities, Lookups) 
 

 *  User training or enablement materials outlining the expected behavior during account merges involving Contacts. 
 *  Assurance that merged Contacts are reflected correctly in downstream systems via integration sync.

834676,Requirement,,,,,19. Detect and Warn Users of Duplicate Contacts Across Sales Skill Accounts,,,,"Business Objective:
 
To ensure data integrity and reduce contact duplication across Water and Hygiene Sales Skill Accounts under the same Base Customer Account (BCA) by warning users in real-time when similar contact records already exist. This will promote reuse of existing contacts, improve customer visibility, and streamline communication across divisions. 

 
Business Requirements: 

 *  When creating or editing a contact under a Sales Skill Account, CRM must check if a similar contact already exists under any other linked Sales Skill Account belonging to the same Base Customer. 
 *  If a potential duplicate is found: 

 *  The system should alert the user before the save completes, showing a warning message with details of the match. 
 *  The message should clearly indicate where the duplicate exists (e.g., “This contact already exists under the Hygiene account for this customer”). 
 *  A list of matched contacts should be shown with key details: Name, Email, Phone, Associated Account, and Contact Owner. 
 *  Users should be given two clear options: 

 *  “Use Existing Contact” – auto-link or reference the existing contact to avoid duplication. 
 *  “Create Anyway” – continue with new contact creation 
 

 *  This applies only to contacts within the same BCA and across Sales Skill Accounts (Water, Hygiene). 
 *  This does not apply to unrelated customer accounts or external divisions. 
 *  Contact de-duplication across business units helps prevent fragmented customer interactions and improves contact management. 
 

 

 
Technical Considerations 

 *  Background logic: 

 *  Trigger real-time or near-real-time contact duplicate detection logic on contact form save or field value change (Name, Email, Phone). 
 *  Matching logic should include: 

 *  Exact or fuzzy match on Email Address. 
 *  Strong match on First + Last Name. 
 *  Optional match on Phone Number. 
 

 *  Search should only run within Sales Skill Accounts tied to the same BCA. 
 

 *  User Interface/Experience Design: 

 *  When duplicates are found, show a modal pop-up window (not inline error) before finalizing contact creation. 
 *  Modal should display: 
 *  Warning banner: “Potential duplicate contact(s) found within this customer’s Sales Skill Accounts.” 
 *  A grid view showing: 

 *  Name 
 *  Email 
 *  Phone 
 *  Related Sales Skill Account 
 *  Buying Role 
 *  Contact Owner 
 

 *  Include radio buttons or checkboxes in the grid to allow users to select an existing contact to reuse. 
 *  Below the grid, provide action buttons: 

 *  Use Selected Contact – This could close the modal and redirect user to the existing contact record or create a reference. 
 *  Create New Contact Anyway – Proceed with creation, with optional reason box (simple comment field). 
 *  Cancel – To exit and modify entered details. 
 

 

 *  Spike required to: 

 *  Evaluate if this behavior can be achieved with native CRM duplicate detection rules or requires custom plugin, JavaScript, or Power Automate extension. 
 *  Validate performance impact of checking across multiple accounts. 
 *  Explore how duplicate warning modal can be implemented with PCF controls or JavaScript dialogs. 
 *  Evaluate integration impacts on downstream systems (Ecolab 3D, Connect, CDM) when contact reuse occurs. 
 

 

 
Expected Deliverables: 

 *  Implement background duplicate detection logic scoped to Sales Skill Accounts under the same BCA. 
 *  Build a responsive model dialog UI for duplicate alerts with grid display and selectable actions. 
 *  Full documentation of match logic, configuration parameters, and UX flow. 
 *  Test coverage: 

 *  Matching accuracy 
 *  Save-blocking behavior (if applicable) 
 *  Merge and reference scenarios 
 

 *  Regression testing for contact creation flows, especially in: 

 *  Merged accounts 
 *  Contact integrations with CDM, Ecolab 3D, Connect 
 

 *  Deployment artifacts and user training collateral to support new duplicate handling behavior.

839699,User Story,,,,Controlled Override of Sales Skill Before Customer Setup Submission,,,,," 
As a business user, I want the ability to update the Sales Skill on a One Customer (1C) account while it is still a Prospect and before the associated Customer Setup record reaches Submitted status, so that I can ensure the correct Sales Skill alignment is captured during setup.
Once the Customer Setup record is submitted, the Sales Skill field must become locked to preserve data integrity and prevent misalignment with downstream processes.
","Yellapantula, Siva",New,Hold; Not In R1; NotNeeded,\FBU 1C,"Yellapantula, Siva",\One Dynamics,2,New,Business,0,"Business Acceptance Criteria:
 
 

 *  Editable Before Customer Setup Exists 

 *  Given an account is a Prospect and no Customer Setup record exists, 

 *  When a user edits the account, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field must be editable and changes are allowed. 
 

 

 *  Editable Before Customer Setup Is Submitted (MDM ID and Process ID has no value in the customer set up record) 

 *  Given an account is a Prospect and a Customer Setup record exists but is not in Submitted status, 

 *  When a user edits the account, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field must remain editable and any changes update the linked Customer Setup record accordingly. 
 

 

 *  Locked After Customer Setup Submission (MDM ID and Process ID has value in the customer set up record) 

 *  Given an account has a Customer Setup record in Submitted status, 

 *  When a user opens the account, 
 *  Then the Sales Skill field must be locked as read-only and cannot be changed by users. 
 

 

 

 

 *  Audit Logging 

 *  Given a user changes the Sales Skill prior to submission, 

 *  When the change is saved, 
 *  Then the system must log the previous and new values in the audit history for traceability. 
 

 

 

Business Requirements:

 *  Editable: Sales Skill must remain editable until Customer Setup reaches Submitted status. 
 *  Locked: Once Customer Setup is Submitted, Sales Skill must be locked for all users. 
 *  Sync: Any change prior to submission must update the global Sales Skill field and related mapping. 
 *  Audit: All Sales Skill changes prior to submission must be captured in audit history. 
 

Developer Notes:

 *  Implement form-level logic: 

 *  If CustomerSetup.Status != Submitted ? Sales Skill editable. 
 *  If CustomerSetup.Status = Submitted ? Sales Skill locked. 
 

 *  Add validation rule on save to enforce lock if attempted update occurs. 
 *  Ensure updates trigger re-filtering of district Sales Skill mapping prior to submission. 
 *  Leverage audit history (CRM standard audit or custom plugin if required) to capture old vs new values of Sales Skill. 
 *  Post-submission ? backend updates only allowed via integration (not end-user edits). 
 *  If a Customer Setup exists and not in Submitted status and if the users tries to update the sales skill on an account, there users should be alerted that a set up record exists and changing sales skill will impact downstream systems.

861014,User Story,,,,Add Sales Skill Column to SOW Grid on H5 Account Tab,,,,,"As a user viewing the Scope of Work (SOW) tab on an H5 account in the CRM app,
I need the grid to display a new Sales Skill column,
 
So that I can easily identify which SOW belongs to Water and which belongs to Hygiene.
 

 
The new Sales Skill column must be placed immediately after the Owner column in the grid.
 
The grid should continue to display existing fields in the current order: Name ? End Date ? Start Date ? Status ? Owner ? Sales Skill.
 
This change will improve user clarity by surfacing the business division context (Water/Hygiene) directly in the grid view without opening individual records.

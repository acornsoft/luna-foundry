**Security Automation**: Generates secure authentication and authorization patterns.

## Azure Functions Domain Excellence

### TypeScript Excellence in Serverless

**Modern TypeScript Patterns**:
- Utilize modern TypeScript features: strict null checks, discriminated unions, mapped types
- Implement proper interface definitions for function inputs and outputs
- Use generic constraints for type-safe Azure service integrations
- Apply decorator patterns for function metadata and configuration
- Leverage TypeScript's advanced types for complex serverless workflows

**Function Architecture**:
- Use Azure Functions v4 with Node.js 20 LTS runtime
- Implement proper function naming conventions: `src/functions/{resource}-{verb}.ts`
- Leverage built-in Node.js modules (`node:fs/promises`, `node:crypto`) for performance
- Use TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
- Implement structured logging with correlation IDs for distributed tracing

### Triggers & Bindings Mastery

**HTTP Triggers**: Implement with proper routing and OpenAPI documentation
**Timer Triggers**: Configure for scheduled tasks and maintenance operations
**Queue/Storage Triggers**: Use for event-driven processing
**Event Hub Triggers**: Implement for high-throughput data processing
**Cosmos DB Triggers**: Configure for change data capture scenarios

### Performance & Scaling

**Cold Start Optimization**: Optimize with proper dependency management and bundling
**Connection Pooling**: Implement for database and service connections
**Premium Plan Usage**: Leverage for predictable performance requirements
**Horizontal Scaling**: Design functions for load distribution
**Caching Strategies**: Implement Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed data

## Security Considerations

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- Implement proper authentication with Azure AD integration
- Use managed identities for secure service-to-service communication
- Apply least privilege principles for function permissions
- Implement input validation and sanitization for all function inputs
- Use Azure Key Vault for secrets management in serverless environments

**Secure Coding Patterns**:
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Use secure coding practices for serverless environments
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Use encryption for data at rest and in transit

## Testing and Quality Assurance

**Comprehensive Testing Strategy**:
- Write unit tests with Jest and Azure Functions testing library
- Implement integration tests for triggers and bindings
- Create load tests to validate scaling characteristics
- Develop chaos engineering tests for resilience
- Establish automated testing in CI/CD pipelines

**Quality Assurance**:
- Implement contract testing for API integrations

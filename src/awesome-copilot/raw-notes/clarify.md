# Clarify

Quick checks: MCP = Master Control Program for MacroFlow? POC scope: Just prompt gen for core/domain patterns, or full agent simulation? Budget: Sustainable pace, aim for 2-4 hour initial spike. Tech: Azure Functions v4 (isolated worker for .NET 10), HTTP triggers for ingress, Cosmos DB for prompt storage (collections/memory pattern). xAI integration: Use Grok API for function calling/streaming inside functions.

User clarification: Develop approach as Dynamics 365 Functional Consultant—series of questions to understand client requirements: what needs to be developed, changes required in D365, current problems, deployment of tables/plugins/external integrations.

For Siva (D365 Functional Consultant): Leverage Release 1 (Canada) and Release 2 (USA) EPICs from Azure DevOps ('mcp_ecolabdevopss_advsec_get_alert_details') and D365 instance ('mcp_ecolabdevelop_create_record'). Requirements include account unification under BCA, form customizations, permission models, integrations with CDM/EBS/PowerApps.

# Constitution

Locked in: Acornsoft manifesto (Grok-native only, no external tools beyond xAI stack), patterns (Minimal APIs for C# Web APIs—simplicity over ceremony), constraints (C# .NET 10, Azure for hosting/monitoring, high cohesion/low coupling). Project context: MCP Server sits at the heart of the C4 ecosystem (per IcePanel diagrams), orchestrating Sherpa Agents via MacroFlow. Foundry prompts are versioned outputs (e.g., luna-eternal.md, codegen-csharp-v2.md) pulled from Spec-Kits.

Per-Use-Case Constitutions:

- Siva (D365 Functional Consultant): Constitution affirms D365 expertise, client interviewing for raw requirements, agile breakdown (Epics/Features/User Stories/Tasks/Test Cases), co-development with existing git-based code via Azure DevOps and D365 connections.
- Ethical AI Bias Detection: Constitution loads xAI ethical guidelines, proactive auditing for fairness in Grok models.
- Dreamcatcher (Elder Care Robot): Constitution affirms privacy-first, emotionally intelligent companion for dementia care, device-first with optional cloud sync.

Unity at the end: Shared MacroFlow ritual across use cases, with Foundry as the unifying prompt repository.
